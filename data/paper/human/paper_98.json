    "article": "classical random walks on form the basis for many successful physics - inspired algorithms . the evolution of probability distributions according to simple update rules for probability spreading\nallows us to sample from thermal distributions ( via the metropolis algorithm @xcite ) or to look for ground - states of physical systems(with simulated annealing @xcite ) .\nthe effectiveness of random - walk based algorithms can be characterized by its mixing time ( how fast it approaches the stationary distribution ) , or by a hitting time ( how fast it reaches a particular vertex ) . for example , the fast mixing of a random walk algorithm for sampling from the thermal distribution of the ising model @xcite forms the basis of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for the permanent of a matrix @xcite .\nthinking about how to utilize the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics , instead of analyzing the diffusion of probabilities , we can ask what happens if we let the amplitudes in a system whose interactions respect some graph structure evolve according to the schrdinger equation .\nthe result of this way of thought are _ quantum walks _\n@xcite , a useful tool in quantum computation .\nthey bring new dynamics ( different wavepacket spreading @xcite ) and algorithmic applications ( e.g. in searching for graph properties @xcite , graph traversal @xcite , game evaluation @xcite ) as well as theoretical results ( universality for computation @xcite ) .\nwe can define quantum walks in discrete time with an additional coin register , or in continuous time , with hamiltonians which are adjacency matrices of graphs . in this paper , we choose the latter approach .\nthe mixing of quantum walks has been previously investigated for several types of graphs \ne.g. on a chain @xcite , a 2d lattice @xcite , hypercubes @xcite and circulant graphs @xcite . in this paper\nwe focus on continuous quantum walks on _ necklaces _  cyclic graphs composed from many ( @xmath0 ) copies of a subgraph of size @xmath1 ( pearls ) , as depicted in fig.[figurenecklaces ] .\nour goal is to provide a simplified approach for finding their eigenvectors and eigenvalues , as well as for analyzing the mixing times for such walks .    the motivation for analyzing this type of graph comes from hamiltonian complexity @xcite .\nquantum computation in the usual circuit model @xcite can be translated into a quantum walk in two ways .\nfirst , following childs @xcite , evolving a wavepacket on a graph with many wires ( representing basis states ) , connected according to the desired quantum circuit .\nsecond , we can use feynman s idea @xcite to view a computation as a `` pointer '' particle doing a quantum walk ( hopping ) in a `` clock '' register , while the computation gets done in a `` data '' register @xcite or particles holding the working data hopping along a graph @xcite . in both cases , we need to look at transmission / reflection properties of the graphs , and their long - term dynamics . specifically\n, we would like to know ( and ensure ) that a computation is done when we want it to be , not having the wavepacket localized ( or spread ) in undesired parts of the graph .\nthis is why we focus on the mixing properties of quantum walks that are underlying quantum computational models based on quantum walks , looking at their spectra in detail .\nnote that proofs of computational complexity for qma - hard problems ( e.g. @xcite ) also involves investigating the ( low - lying ) spectrum of a quantum walk .\nthe simplest graph involved in the feynman - like models is a line or a cycle , and the dynamics for this quantum walk are well understood @xcite .\nwe look at continuous - time quantum walks on _ necklace _ graphs , which appear in the analysis of quantum computational models @xcite that generalize the feynman approach .\nnecklace graphs could also be viewed as implementing dynamics for quantum walks on imperfect cycles .    utilizing the cyclic structure of the necklaces , we propose a bloch - type ansatz for the eigenfunctions , allowing us to obtain several results .\nfirst , in section [ sec : ansatz ] we reduce the problem of finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the quantum walk on a necklace of @xmath0 pearls of size @xmath1 to diagonalizing a @xmath2 matrix @xmath0 times ( compared to full @xmath3 diagonalization .\nsecond , in section [ sec : mixing ] , we analyze average - time mixing for quantum walks on necklaces and find a general method for showing convergence to the limiting distribution . finally , in section [ sec : examples ] , we work out examples of quantum walks on particular necklaces , giving analytic ( and numerical ) results for the eigenvectors , eigenvalues and the scaling of the mixing time , concluding with open questions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .\nconsider a quantum system with a hamiltonian @xmath4 given by the adjacency matrix of a necklace - like structure .\nthe simplest necklace is a cycle with @xmath0 vertices .\na  general necklace is a collection of @xmath0 pearls ( small identical graphs with @xmath1 nodes ) , connected into a cycle as in fig .\n[ figurenecklaces ] .\nwe label points in the @xmath5-th pearl @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .\nthe endpoints of the @xmath5-th pearl ( connected to the previous and following pearls ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 let @xmath10 be the adjacency matrix of a pearl .\nthe hamiltonian for the whole necklace is a sum of intra - pearl terms and the connections between them : @xmath11    our goal is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath4 .\nbecause of the underlying cyclic structure of a general necklace graph with @xmath0 pearls , we can assume that its eigenvectors will have a structure related to a plane wave on a cycle with @xmath0 nodes .\nlet us then look at the @xmath0-node cycle first . there\nthe hamiltonian has no @xmath12 s in it , allowing us to find the ( plane - wave ) eigenvectors of @xmath13 : @xmath14 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath15 parametrized by momenta @xmath16 : @xmath17 for @xmath18 .     and\n@xmath19.,width=249 ]    consider now a general necklace with @xmath0 pearls .\nwe expect the eigenvectors of the necklace hamiltonian to have a form resembling , also depending on the momenta @xmath16 .\nlet us thus look for the eigenvectors of @xmath4 in the form @xmath20 where each @xmath21 is a normalized vector with support only on the @xmath5-th pearl ( the vertices @xmath22 ) . using and\n, we obtain @xmath23 where the last two terms correspond to the amplitudes on the endpoints of the @xmath5-th pearl coming from the endpoints of the neighboring pearls . notice that because of our parametrization\n, the hamiltonian is now block - diagonalized , acting in the same way on each pearl ( see figure [ figurenecklacepb ] ) .\nwhen @xmath24 is an eigenvector of @xmath4 , we also have @xmath25 using and , finding the eigenvalues of @xmath4 thus reduces to diagonalizing the @xmath2 matrix @xmath26 where @xmath10 is the adjacency matrix of a pearl , and @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has only two non - zero elements in the corners if a pearl has two distinct roots @xmath28 and @xmath29 .\nthere is a special case when a pearl is connected to the rest of the necklace through a single root vertex @xmath28 .\nthere , the matrix @xmath30 has a single nonzero element and reads @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] diagonalizing gives us @xmath1-dimensional vectors @xmath32 . for each @xmath33\n, there will be @xmath1 of these , and we will label them @xmath34 with @xmath35 .\nthe corresponding eigenvalues @xmath36 of @xmath37 are also the eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian @xmath4 .\ntherefore , to find all the @xmath38 eigenvalues @xmath36 of the necklace hamiltonian with @xmath0 pearls , we need to diagonalize the @xmath2 matrix @xmath37 for each @xmath33 . to get the eigenvectors of @xmath4 from the eigenvectors of @xmath37 , we plug the coefficients @xmath39 of the vectors we just found into and .    in conclusion , the ansatz simplifies the general problem of diagonalizing the @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 to diagonalizing an @xmath2 matrix @xmath0 times .\nthis is useful especially when @xmath1 is small and @xmath0 is large .\nour focus in what follows will be on mixing of continuous quantum walks on many - pearled ( large-@xmath0 ) necklaces .\ntime evolution according to the schrdinger equation with a hamiltonian that is an adjacency matrix of a graph produces a continuous time quantum walk .\nlet the eigenvectors of the system be @xmath40 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath15 .\nwhen starting from an initial state @xmath41 , the probability of finding the `` walker '' at vertex @xmath42 at time @xmath43 ( measuring position @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 the evolution is unitary , so it does not mix towards a time - independent stationary distribution like a classical markov process . on the other hand , we can think about mixing for a quantum walk in a time - averaged sense , investigating a time - averaged probability distribution .\nit holds information about the probability of finding the system at a particular vertex at time @xmath43 , chosen uniformly at random between @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( a chosen limiting time ) : @xmath48 this time - averaged probability has a well - defined @xmath49 limit , which gives us the _ limiting probability distribution _ , expressible using the eigenvectors of @xmath4 as : @xmath50 where the final sum goes over pairs of equal eigenvalues .\nnote that for some quantum walks this limiting distribution can be dependent on the initial state ( e.g. when we start in some eigenstate ) , so we will keep the superscript @xmath51 around .    to determine how fast the time - averaged probability converges towards the limiting distribution , we need to bound the total distribution distance @xmath52 .\nusing , integrating an exponential and realizing that the terms summed over pairs of equal eigenvalues subtract out , we arrive at @xmath53 where the sum now goes over pairs of eigenvalues that are not equal .\nwe can put an upper bound on this expression by a technique similar to @xcite .\nfirst , we use @xmath54 and move the absolute value inside the sums , to obtain @xmath55 the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath56 allows us to perform the sum over @xmath44 , resulting in @xmath57 after another use of the cauchy - schwartz inequality on the terms involving @xmath41 , realizing the expression is symmetric under exchange of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we finally obtain @xmath60 which corresponds to lemma 4.3 of @xcite .\nit involves a sum of the inverse of eigenvalue differences .\nthese terms can be large , but as @xmath47 grows , the @xmath61 factor can bring the total variation difference to zero .\nit is our task now to investigate how fast this happens .\nwe seek @xmath62 ( the _ mixing time _ ) , for which @xmath63 would hold for all @xmath64 , given any precision parameter @xmath65 .      for our first example\n, we now follow @xcite and compute the limiting distribution for the case of a walk on a cycle . later\n, we will show that the time - averaged probability converges to it for times @xmath66 , using a more general mixing result proved in section [ sec : method ] .\nthe eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the continuous - time quantum walk on a cycle are given by and .\nwe obtain the limiting distribution from by summing over the few nonzero terms .\nthe sum over the equal eigenvalues splits into a sum over @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( degenerate eigenvalue pairs ) .\nwhen the initial state @xmath41 is concentrated at a vertex @xmath69 , in the case of even @xmath0 , the limiting distribution for the quantum walk on a cycle is @xmath70 where @xmath71 for all pairs @xmath72 , with an exception for the two points @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where its value is @xmath75 . for a cycle with an odd length @xmath0 , we get @xmath76 with @xmath77 defined in the same way as for even @xmath0 , equal to zero for all pairs @xmath72 except for @xmath73 , where @xmath78 . the slight differences from a uniform distribution arise because not all of the eigenvalues are doubly degenerate .\nproving that the time - averaged distribution converges towards the limiting distribution for @xmath79 takes more work .\nwe want to show that the total distribution distance @xmath52 goes to zero as @xmath79 .\nwhen computing @xmath80 , the terms with @xmath81 produce the limiting distribution @xmath82 and are thus subtracted out .\nhowever , the terms left over ( which were killed by the @xmath83 limit when computing @xmath84 ) need to be carefully accounted for and govern the convergence . in ,\nwe have a bound on the total distribution distance by a sum over pairs of inequal eigenvalues .\nwe will upper bound this sum in section [ sec : method ] , using a general approach of lower bounding the terms @xmath85 in .\nthis result is then applicable to several other walks on necklaces .\nthe rate of convergence of the time - averaged distribution towards the limiting distribution is governed by a sum of @xmath86 over non - equal eigenvalues as in .\nwe will now show a method for upper bounding it that will work in several cases .\nfirst , let us choose two particular sectors of eigenvalues , fixing @xmath87 and @xmath88 .\nit is often possible to bound the eigenvalue differences for this sector as @xmath89 for some constant @xmath90 , where where @xmath91 are the momenta , and the indices @xmath92 run from @xmath46 to @xmath93 , observing @xmath94 .\nwe will rewrite using the substitution @xmath95 and @xmath96 .\n@xmath97 where @xmath98 while @xmath99 , and @xmath100 while @xmath101 .\nfirst , because of symmetry , we observe that it is enough to sum only over @xmath102 and multiply the resulting sum by 4 .\nsecond , it can only increase our upper bound if we count all @xmath103 , instead of having to take care with counting starting at @xmath104 .\nthe symmetry of the term involving @xmath105 then again allows us to sum only up to @xmath106 and multiply the result by 4 .\ntherefore , we obtain @xmath107 recalling now that @xmath108 , we can deal with each sum as @xmath109 thus finally expressing the sum in ( note that we worked only in a single @xmath110 sector ) as @xmath111 where the extra factor @xmath112 comes from the term @xmath113 , when we expect the initial state to have roughly equal overlap with all momentum states . according to and working this out for all sectors\n@xmath110 , this suffices to show an upper bound on the mixing time ( in the time - averaged sense ) for this type of quantum walk , which grows with the system size a @xmath114 .\nwe will now show that for particular examples of walks on necklaces , the eigenvalues obey , and so that we can use the above approach for proving their convergence .\nthe first example that we can deal with using this method is the cycle itself , where is an equality .\ntherefore , we have just shown that the time - averaged distribution ( when starting from a single point ) converges to the limiting distribution for a cycle of length @xmath0 with mixing time @xmath115 ( up to logarithmic factors ) .\nwe now look at a specific type of necklaces , which appear in the quantum - walk based model of computation @xcite .\nthese `` combs '' are constructed from a ring of length @xmath116 by attaching an extra node ( tooth ) to the ring at every @xmath117-th vertex as in fig .\n[ figurecombkd ] .\nthe `` pearl '' in this comb - like graph has size @xmath118 , and there are @xmath0 of them , so the total number of vertices in this graph is @xmath119 .\nwe will now analyze the spectra and mixing properties on the @xmath120-comb necklaces , showing their similarity to ( and differences from ) a simple cycle .\n-comb graph is a ring of length @xmath121 , with an extra vertex connected at every @xmath117-th node.,width=240 ]      this is the simplest of the graphs , with a pearl that has only two nodes ( the base and the tooth ) : @xmath123.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath10 has a single root , the matrix @xmath30 needed to construct @xmath37 reads @xmath124.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the matrix @xmath37 is @xmath125.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its eigenvalues are @xmath126 and the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath127\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the upper vector component corresponds to the base ( and the lower component to the tooth ) of the comb .\naccording to , this gives us the eigenvectors of @xmath4 as @xmath128_{(j)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath129 for @xmath18 .\nthe eigenvalues @xmath15 of the hamiltonian are symmetrically distributed around zero , and each of them is also doubled if @xmath0 is even .\nnote that two of the eigenvectors @xmath130 are zero on every other base and tooth , and correspond to eigenvalues @xmath131 .\nthe limiting distribution is analyzed in appendix [ app : comb1 ] .\nwe find that for large @xmath0 , the limiting distribution ( when starting from a base vertex ) is @xmath132 on base vertices and @xmath133 on teeth , with corrections for the initial vertex and the vertex across from it .\nwe now prove convergence to the time - averaged limiting distribution , showing that the ( time - averaged ) mixing on this densest comb is no different than the one we saw for a cycle .\nwe will upper bound the sum in by the method in section [ sec : method ] , dividing the eigenvalues into 4 regions , @xmath134 , corresponding to choices of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the @xmath135 and @xmath136 regions , we have @xmath137 so the inverse of such terms does not govern the scaling in .\nthe important region combinations must then be @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where a few lines of algebra give us @xmath140 as the eigenvalues are well bounded away from zero .\narmed with this inequality , and the fact that the overlap of a single - starting - vertex initial state with the eigenvectors scales as @xmath141 , we can now use the result of section [ sec : method ] .\nthis gives us an upper bound on the mixing time for the @xmath122-comb necklace , scaling with @xmath0 as @xmath142 , i.e. the same as for a cycle with no teeth , up to logarithmic factors .\nthe next example is the @xmath143 comb .\nit has a tooth ( extra vertex ) at every second node of the basic loop , so its pearl @xmath10 has three vertices .\nwe label the base of the tooth as vertex 1 , and the top of the tooth as vertex 2 , giving : @xmath144.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the procedure of section [ sec : ansatz ] , we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath145 constructed as in : @xmath146 +     \\left [        \\begin{array}{ccc }           0 & 0 & e^{-ip_k } \\\\           0 & 0 & 0 \\\\           e^{ip_k } & 0 & 0        \\end{array }     \\right ] =     \\left [        \\begin{array}{ccc }           0 & 1 & e^{-\\frac{ip_k}{2 } } 2\\cos \\frac{p_k}{2 } \\\\           1 & 0 & 0 \\\\           e^{\\frac{ip_k}{2 } } 2\\frac{\\cos p_k}{2 } & 0 & 0        \\end{array }     \\right ]     .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after some algebra , we find that its three eigenvalues are @xmath147 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath148 ,     \\qquad        { | y^{\\,(k,\\pm ) } \\rangle } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 ( 3 + 2\\cos p_k ) } } \\left [         \\begin{array}{c }        \\pm \\sqrt{3 + 2\\cos p_k } \\\\         1 \\\\         2 e^{-\\frac{ip_k}{2 } } \\cos\\frac{p_k}{2 } \\\\\n\\end{array }     \\right ] .\n\\label{k2eigenvectors}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to construct the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath4 , we use in equation .\nlet us now look for a lower bound on the gap between eigenvalues .\nwhen we choose two eigenvalues from different sectors ( @xmath46 , @xmath149 or @xmath150 ) , the differences between them are always larger than @xmath151 .\nthe only interesting cases are thus the @xmath138 and @xmath139 choices of eigenvalue pairs . there\nwe find @xmath152 this lower bound on the nonzero eigenvalue gaps allows us to use the results of section [ sec : method ] and prove the upper bound @xmath153 on the mixing time for the @xmath143-comb .\nthis is once again the same upper bound we found for the cycle and the @xmath122-comb in section [ sec : k1 ] .      in the last example we want to show that comb - like necklaces with @xmath117 vertices between teeth ( see figure [ figurecombkd ] ) mix similarly to cycles .\nwe dealt with the most non - cycle - like examples in the previous sections , and now we will numerically look at combs with general spacing @xmath117 .\nthe results for the smallest nonzero eigenvalue differences for @xmath154 combs are shown in figure [ figurecombeigs ] . in a log - log plot of the smallest eigenvalue difference vs. the number of pearls @xmath0 ( for various values of @xmath117 ) , we see the characteristic @xmath155 scaling .\nthus , the numerics imply that the scaling of the mixing time gets no worse than @xmath156\n. however , it is likely that the eigenvalue differences also obey the cos - like scaling as we have seen for @xmath157 .\nif we could show this , we would again prove that the mixing time scales with @xmath0 as @xmath158 .\n-comb graphs ( see figure [ figurecombkd ] ) and a cycle .\na straight - line fit through the datapoins indicates a @xmath155 scaling with the growing number of pearls.,width=288 ]\nthe goal of this paper was to utilize the cyclical repetitive structure of necklace - like graphs , providing a general method for analyzing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of continuous - time quantum walks on such graphs . using a bloch - theorem - like ansatz , we block - diagonalized the hamiltonian , decreasing the effective size of the problem from @xmath38 to @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the size of a pearl and @xmath0 is the number of pearls in the necklace .\nnext , we wanted to investigate the mixing times ( for approaching a limiting distribution in a time - averaged sense ) for these quantum walks . in section\n[ sec : method ] we have shown that proving a @xmath159-like lower bound on ( non - equal ) eigenvalue differences results in a mixing time @xmath115 for a graph with @xmath0 pearls , which is the same as for a cycle with @xmath0 nodes . note though , that the prefactor in the mixing time can depend on the size of the pearl @xmath1 . finally , in section [ sec : examples ] we exhibited the bound ( and thus the cycle - like mixing time ) for two necklace - like graphs .\nthese graphs appear in the models of quantum computation @xcite that extend the feynman - computer with the so - called railroad switches , and finding the polynomial - time ( in @xmath0 ) scaling of the mixing - time is required for showing their effectiveness .\ndn acknowledges support from the slovak research and development agency under the contract no .\nlpp-0430 -

averaged limiting distribution for going from base @xmath162 to base @xmath163 ( which thanks to the identity turns out to be the same as for going from tooth @xmath164 to tooth @xmath165 ) , obtaining @xmath166 where the last term involving @xmath167 occurs only for even @xmath0 . using the identities @xmath168 and denoting @xmath169 @xmath170 with @xmath77 defined in , we rewrite to finally obtain @xmath171      -comb when starting from the base of the @xmath174th pearl for odd @xmath175 ( left ) and even @xmath176 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=268 ] -comb when starting from the base of the @xmath174th pearl for odd @xmath175 ( left ) and even @xmath176 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=268 ]    finally , let us look at the high @xmath0 approximation ( see also fig.[k1lim ] ) . in @xmath177\nwe replaced the sum by an integral and obtained @xmath178 . at points @xmath69\nfor which @xmath179 , the expression @xmath180 equals @xmath177 exactly , while it rapidly falls off to zero with growing distance of @xmath69 from @xmath44 ( or @xmath181 ) .\nthe limiting distribution when starting from a base point for even number of pearls is thus well approximated by a flat distribution with @xmath182 on bases and @xmath183 on teeth , with the exception of the starting pearl and the pearl exactly opposite to it receiving @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .\nit is very similar for odd @xmath0 , except that we do not have the special case of the opposite pearl . for an example of the limiting distribution with odd and even @xmath0 , see fig .\n[ k1lim ] .",
