    "abstract": " i start by reviewing existing @xmath0 measurements with particular emphasis on the recent 221 mev @xmath0 measurement at triumf which permitted the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 to be determined separately for the first time . \n i then review @xmath3 experiments , with specific details of the @xmath4 experiment now under preparation at los alamos national laboratory . \n this experiment will provide a clean measurement of the weak pion nucleon coupling , @xmath5 . \n finally , i discuss @xmath6 parity violation experiments , particularly the gzero experiment under way at jefferson lab in virginia . \n this experiment will measure the weak form factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , allowing the distribution of strange quarks in the quark sea to be determined .
