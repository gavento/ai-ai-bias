    "article": "gliese 229b is not only the first brown dwarf recognized as genuine @xcite , but it is also the brightest and best - studied t dwarf known . with an effective temperature of @xmath5k , it lies squarely between the latest l dwarfs ( @xmath6k , @xcite ) and the giant planets of the solar system ( @xmath7k ) .\nindeed , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong h@xmath8o absorption bands characteristic of very - low mass stars and the strong ch@xmath9 bands seen in the spectra of jupiter , saturn and titan .\nthe transitional nature of the spectrum of gl 229b is remarkable and hints at the spectral appearance of extrasolar giant planets which have effective temperatures in the range 200 \n1600@xmath10k @xcite .\na wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery five years ago .\nbroad band photometry from @xmath11 through @xmath12 and an accurate parallax @xcite allow an accurate determination of its bolometric luminosity .\nspectroscopic observations @xcite covering the range from 0.8 to 5.0@xmath13 m have revealed a very rapidly declining flux shortward of 1@xmath13 m , the unmistakable presence of ch@xmath9 , h@xmath8o , and cs , and demonstrated the _ absence _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio features characteristic of late m and early l dwarfs .\nfinally , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and @xcite have detected co with an abundance well above the value predicted by chemical equilibrium , a phenomenon also seen in the atmosphere of jupiter .\nmodel spectra for gl 229b @xcite reproduce the overall energy distribution fairly well and all agree that 1 ) @xmath5k , 2 ) compared to gaseous molecular opacity , the dust opacity is small if not negligible in the infrared , 3 ) the gravity of gl 229b is poorly constrained at present .\nthe rapid decline of the flux at wavelengths shortward of 1@xmath13 m is interpreted as caused by an absorbing haze of complex hydrocarbons ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or alternatively by the pressure - broadened red wing of the k i resonance doublet at 0.77@xmath13 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1999 ; burrows , marley & sharp 1999 ) .    in this paper , we present new high - resolution spectra in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . with the inclusion of the `` red '' spectrum of @xcite , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain independent measures of the h@xmath8o abundance of gl 229b  broadly interpreted as the metallicity index  to detect for the first time the presence of nh@xmath3 in its spectrum , and to estimate the nh@xmath3 abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere .\nour results are expressed in terms of the surface gravity which can not be determined from the data presented here .\nnevertheless , we identify a reduced set of acceptable combinations of @xmath14 and gravity , using the observed bolometric luminosity of gl 229b @xcite .\nthe observations and the near infrared spectra are presented in  2 .\nsection 3 shows how an accurate parallax , a well - sampled spectral energy distribution and evolutionary models greatly reduce the possible range of combinations of @xmath14 and gravity without having to resort to spectrum fitting . the synthetic spectrum calculation and our method of analysis\nare described in  4 .\nthe results concerning several molecules of interest which are at least potentially detectable are presented in  5 , followed by a discussion in  6 .\nfinally , a summary of the results and directions for future study are given in  7 .\nspectra of gl  229b in selected narrow intervals in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 windows were obtained at the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 january , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 @xcite and its 150 l / mm grating . details of the observations are provided in table 1 .\nthese are among the highest resolution spectra obtained of any t dwarf .\nthe spectra were obtained in the standard stare / nod mode with the @xmath15 wide slit of the spectrometer oriented at a position angle of @xmath16 , nearly perpendicular to the line connecting gl 229a and gl 229b .\nthe southward - going diffraction spike of gl 229a together with scattered light from that star , which is 10 magnitudes brighter than gl 229b , contaminated the array rows near and to the southwest of those containing the spectrum of gl 229b .\nthe contamination on the gl 229b rows was determined by interpolation and was subtracted ; typically it was comparable or somewhat smaller than the signal from gl  229b . in order to remove telluric absorption features , spectra of the a0v star bs  1849 were measured just prior to gl  229b . in all cases the match in airmasses was better than five percent and hence in the ratioed spectra residual telluric features are small compared to the noise level .\nwavelength calibration was achieved by observations of arc lamps and is in all cases better than one part in @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .\nthe spectra shown in this paper have been slightly smoothed , so that the resolving powers are lower than those in table 1 by approximately 25 percent .\nthey also have been rebinned to facilitate coadding like spectra and joining adjacent spectral regions .\nthe error bars can be judged by the point - to - point variations in featureless portions of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratios at the continuum peaks are approximately 40 in the @xmath2 band , 25 in the @xmath1 band , and 30 in the @xmath0 band .\nthe flux calibration of each spectrum is approximate as no attempt was made to match the photometry of gl 229b .\nwhile we identify the spectra by their corresponding standard photometric infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages are much narrower than the @xmath19 filters and typically corresponds to the peak flux of gl 229b in each bandpass .    in the @xmath0 band spectrum ( fig .\n1 ) , nearly all features are caused by h@xmath8o .\nthe short wavelength end of the spectrum shows the red side of a ch@xmath9 band , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of @xmath20 m .\ntwo lines of neutral potassium are easily detected near @xmath21 m .\nno other lines of alkali metals fall within the wavelength coverage of our observations .\nthe @xmath1 band spectrum ( fig .\n2 ) is relatively rich in molecular opacity sources .\nall the features seen in the spectrum are either due to h@xmath8o ( @xmath22 m ) or part of a very strong ch@xmath9 absorption band ( @xmath23 m )\n. features seen between 1.59 and 1.6@xmath13 m can not presently be ascribed with certainty and are due to either h@xmath8o or ch@xmath9 . while the opacities of nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s are not negligible in this part of the spectrum , neither molecule forms distinctive spectral features .\ntheir presence can not be directly ascertained from these data , mainly because their opacity is weaker than that of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 and because of significant pressure broadening ( see  5.3 ) .\nthe @xmath2 band flux emerges in an opacity window between a strong h@xmath8o band and a strong ch@xmath9 band ( fig .\nspectral features are caused by h@xmath8o at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath24 m ) and by ch@xmath9 at longer wavelengths ( @xmath25 m ) .\nseveral distinctive features of nh@xmath3 are expected at the blue end of this spectrum and models predict a single absorption feature of h@xmath8s at @xmath26 m .\nall features seen in figures 1  3 are unresolved blends of numerous molecular transitions .\na spectral resolution at least 10 times higher would be required to resolve the intrinsic structure of the spectrum of gl 229b .\nwhile synthetic spectra have been fairly successful at reproducing the unusual spectrum of gl 229b @xcite , the entire spectral energy distribution has not yet been modeled satisfactorily .\nlimitations in the opacity databases are partly responsible for the remaining discrepancies between synthetic spectra and the data ( see  4.2 ) .\nthese shortcomings have impeded the determination of @xmath14 and of the gravity @xmath27 in particular .\non the other hand , the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b is now well determined . combining spectroscopic and photometric data from 0.82 to 10@xmath13 m with the parallax\n, @xcite found @xmath28 . with new @xmath29 photometry\n, @xcite found @xmath30 .\na recalibration using the hst photometry of @xcite gives @xmath31 .\nevolutionary models @xcite allow us to find a family of @xmath32 models with a given @xmath33 .\nfigure 4 shows the cooling tracks of solar metallicity brown dwarfs in terms of the surface parameters @xmath14 and @xmath27 .\nmodels with the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b fall within the band running through the center of the figure . using a very conservative lower limit for the age of gl 229a of 0.2@xmath10gyr @xcite\n, we find @xmath34k . on the other hand , the gravity remains poorly determined with @xmath35 , corresponding to a mass range of 0.015  0.07@xmath36 . while the upper range is very close to the lower main sequence mass limit ,\ngl 229b s status as a brown dwarf is secure\n. a star at the edge of the main sequence would be much hotter with @xmath37k ; well outside of fig .\n4 .    in the remainder of this paper ,\nthe discussion focuses on three atmosphere models which span the range of allowed solutions ( table 2 and fig .\n4 ) : @xmath38 ( 870 , 4.5 ) , ( 940 , 5.0 ) and ( 1030 , 5.5 ) , which we label models a , b , and c , respectively . these constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath27 from cooling sequences are quite firm .\nwe find the same result , within the error bar on @xmath33 , from several cooling sequences which predate @xcite .\nthe latter were computed with different input physics such as the equation of state and surface boundary conditions derived from grey and non - grey atmosphere models using several opacity tabulations .    in section 5 , we show that these three models can fit the spectra only if they have different metallicities , ranging from [ m / h]@xmath39 to @xmath40 . the evolution of brown dwarfs is sensitive to the metallicity through the atmospheric opacity which controls the rate of cooling . we find that for the range of interest here , the effect of a reduced metallicity on our determination of @xmath14 , @xmath27 , and the cooling age is smaller but comparable to that of the uncertainty on the value of @xmath33 . we choose to ignore it for simplicity .\nour analysis is based on the atmosphere models of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets described in @xcite . briefly\n, the atmospheres are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer is solved with the k - coefficient method .\nthe chemical equilibrium is treated as in @xcite .\ngas phase opacities include rayleigh scattering , the collision - induced opacity of h@xmath8 and the molecular opacities of h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , nh@xmath3 , h@xmath8s , ph@xmath3 , and co , as well as the continuum opacities of h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 . the molecular line opacity database is described in more detail in  4.2 .\natomic line opacity is not included .\nbecause of the relatively large gravity of gl 229b , pressure broadening of the molecular lines plays an important role in determining the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere and in shaping the spectrum .\nthe line - by - line broadening theory we use is described in @xcite .\nthe strong continuum opacity source responsible for the rapid decrease of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 1.1@xmath13 m is included following the haze model of @xcite .\ndetails of the haze model and of our fitting procedure are given in  5.1 .\nthe @xmath43 structures of these atmosphere models are shown in fig .\nthe profiles intersect each other because both @xmath14 and the gravity vary between the models .\nthe inflexion point at @xmath44 signals the top of the convection zone .    using the same monochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients ,\nhigh - resolution synthetic spectra are generated from the atmospheric structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on a frequency grid with @xmath45@xmath46 .\nspectra with resolution lower than @xmath47@xmath46 can then be generated for comparison with data .\nan unusual aspect of t dwarf atmospheres is the great variation of the opacity with wavelength .\nthese atmospheres are strongly non - grey and the near infrared spectrum is sculpted by strong absorption bands of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 . most of the flux emerges in a small number of relatively transparent opacity windows .\nthe concept of photosphere becomes rather useless since the level at which the spectrum is formed depends strongly on the wavelength .\nfigure 6 shows the depth of the `` photosphere '' @xmath48 in both temperature and pressure as a function of wavelength for model b ( @xmath49k , @xmath50 ) . in the @xmath51 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @xmath2 and @xmath52 bands ,\nthe atmosphere is very transparent and can be probed to great depths . for @xmath53\nm , the spectral energy distribution approaches a planck function with @xmath54k .\nfigure 6 reveals that spectroscopy between 0.8 and 12@xmath13 m can probe the atmosphere from @xmath54k down to a depth where @xmath55k , corresponding to a range of 6 pressure scale heights ! this provides an exceptional opportunity to study the physics of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended vertical range .\nthe top of the convection zone for model b ( located at @xmath56k ) is below the `` photosphere '' at all wavelengths and is not directly observable , however .      given the range of acceptable values of @xmath14 and @xmath27 (  3 ) , we can determine the metallicity of gl 229b and the abundance of several key molecules by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations , for each of the three models .\nthe precision of our results is determined by the reliability of the models , the noise level in the data and , most significantly , by the limitations of the molecular line lists used to compute their opacities .\nthe latter point requires a detailed discussion .\nthe opacities of ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 are computed from line lists obtained by combining the hitran @xcite and geisa @xcite databases , which are complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations .\nfurther details are provided in @xcite .\nthe resulting line lists for these two molecules are very nearly complete for @xmath57k , and their degree of completeness decreases rapidly at higher temperatures where absorption from excited level become important .\nfurthermore , the line list of ch@xmath9 is limited to @xmath58 m .\nwe extend the ch@xmath9 opacity to shorter wavelengths with the laboratory measurements of @xcite which provide the absorption coefficient averaged over intervals of 5@xmath10@xmath46 between 1 and 5@xmath13 m at @xmath59k .\nwe use @xcite opacities for @xmath60 m and the line list for @xmath61 m .\nthis puts the transition from one tabulation to the other in a strong h@xmath8o absorption band and obliterates any discontinuity in ch@xmath9 opacity at the transition . for @xmath62\nm , the tabulation of @xcite gives the absorption coefficient of ch@xmath9 determined from spectroscopic observations of the giant planets at 0.0004@xmath13 m intervals . because of the low temperatures found in the atmospheres of giant planets , the karkoschka ch@xmath9 opacities are appropriate for @xmath63k . to our knowledge\n, this compilation of nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath9 opacity is the most complete presently available .    as can be seen in figure 6 ,\nthe temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is everywhere greater than 300@xmath10k .\nfor ch@xmath9 , we compute temperature - dependent line opacity ( which is incomplete above 300@xmath10k ) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for @xmath61 m , and use temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths . while the synthetic spectra computed reproduce the fundamental band of ch@xmath9 very well ( centered at @xmath64 m ) , the match with the 1.6 and 2.3@xmath13 m bands is rather poor . even though ch@xmath9 is a very prominent molecule in the spectrum of gl 229b ,\nthe current knowledge of its opacity is not adequate for a quantitative analysis of its spectral signature .\nfor this reason , we have essentially ignored the regions in our spectra where ch@xmath9 is prominent . unfortunately\n, this prevents us from estimating the abundance of ch@xmath9  and therefore of carbon  in gl 229b .\nammonia shows significant absorption in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra .\nthe line list for nh@xmath3 starts at @xmath65 m . because the line list does not include transitions from highly excited levels which occur at @xmath66k , the nh@xmath3 opacity we compute at a given wavelength is strictly a lower limit to the actual opacity .\nexcept for the collision - induced absorption by h@xmath8 , the most important molecular absorber in gl 229b is h@xmath8o , for which the opacity is now relatively well understood .\nwe use the most recent and most extensive ab initio line list ( @xcite , @xmath67 transitions ) .\nthis line list is essentially complete for @xmath68k . as a demonstration of the equality of this database , we find that the h@xmath8o features computed with this line list correspond extremely well in frequency with the observed features of gl 229b ( _ e.g. _ figs . 7 to 9 ) .\nhowever , we find noticeable discrepancies in the relative strengths of h@xmath8o features which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions (  5.1 ) .\nthis effect can also be seen in fig .\n1c of @xcite . at high resolution ,\nthe distribution of molecular transitions in frequency and strength is nearly random , and the inaccuracies in oscillator strengths we have found limit the accuracy of model fitting in a fashion similar to noise .\nthis `` opacity noise '' is at least as significant as the noise intrinsic to our data .\nwe have constructed a grid of synthetic spectra for the three models shown in fig .\n4 with metallicity @xmath69 } \\le 0.1 $ ] in steps of 0.1 .\nwe use these modeled spectra to fit four distinct spectral regions ( the `` red '' , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectra ) separately to determine the metallicity as a function of gravity with an internal precision of @xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the data ,\nthe synthetic spectra were renormalized to the observed flux at a selected wavelength in each spectral region .\nthe model spectra show some distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum which are probably due to remaining uncertainties in the @xmath71 profile of the atmosphere , the inadequate ch@xmath9 opacities , and possible effects of dust opacity .\nconsidering the additional problems with the strength of the h@xmath8o features , we elected to do all fits `` by eye , '' except where otherwise noted .\nwe discuss the fitting of each spectral interval below . in the interest of brevity , we present a detailed discussion of fits obtained only with the model of intermediate gravity ( model b ) .\nthe best fits obtained with models a and c are very nearly identical to those with model b. the results are summarized in table 2 .\nthe `` red '' spectrum extends from 0.83 to @xmath72 m and is formed deep in the atmosphere where @xmath73k .\nthe spectra of @xcite and @xcite reveal two lines of cs i ( at 0.852 and 0.894@xmath13 m ) and a strong h@xmath8o band but _ not _ the bands of tio and vo common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs ( fig . 7 ) .\nrefractory elements , such as ti , fe , v , ca , and cr , are expected to be bound in condensed compounds in a low - temperature atmosphere such as that of gl 229b and therefore are not available to form molecular bands @xcite . with the exception of the strong , unidentified feature at 0.9874@xmath13 m , all features between 0.89 and 1.0@xmath13\nm can be attributed to h@xmath8o .\nan overlap of a weak band of h@xmath8o and a weaker ch@xmath9 band causes the small depression at 0.894@xmath13 m which was tentatively tentatively attributed to ch@xmath9 by @xcite and @xcite .\nfeatures below 0.89@xmath13 m can not be identified at present .\nthe two cs i lines are not included in our model .\nthe flux from gl 229b is also observed to decrease very rapidly toward shorter wavelengths @xcite , which , in the absence of the strong tio and vo bands , is evidently caused by the presence of a missing source of opacity in the atmosphere .\nspectra computed with molecular opacities only ( but excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) predict visible fluxes which are grossly overestimated @xcite but the detailed sequence of absorption features of the spectrum are well reproduced , indicating that the short wavelength flux is suppressed by a _\nopacity source .\nwe fit the red spectrum of gl 229b between 0.82 and 1.15@xmath13 m to obtain the metallicity .\nwe have recalibrated the published spectrum @xcite using the hst photometry of @xcite .\nwe model the continuum opacity with a layer of condensates following the approach of @xcite .\ncondensates are expected in the atmosphere of gl 229b on the basis of chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite and can provide the required opacity . alternatively , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and burrows , marley , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this rapid decline to the pressure broadened red wing of the 0.77@xmath13 m k i resonance doublet .\nthe first optical spectrum of a t dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the latter explanation is correct @xcite . the nature of this opacity source is not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the proper continuum opacity background is present in the calculation .\nthe dust opacity is computed with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles and is determined by the vertical distribution of the particles , their grain size distribution , and the complex index of refraction of the condensate .\nthe cloud model of @xcite is described by 1 ) the vertical density profile of the condensate , taken as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number density of condensed particles , @xmath76 is the ambient gas pressure , and the cloud layer is bound by @xmath77 2 ) the size distribution of the particles @xmath78 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the diameter of the particles ; and 3 ) the complex index of refraction of the condensate @xmath80 the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the function @xmath85 , and the metallicity of the atmosphere are free parameters .\nsuch a multi - parameter fit of the observed spectrum is not unique .\nfurthermore , arbitrarily good fits of the `` continuum '' flux level can be obtained by adjusting the imaginary part of the index of refraction since its wavelength dependence is weakly constrained _ a priori_. our results for the three models are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite .\ntypical values of the fitted dust parameters are @xmath86@xmath87bar@xmath88 , @xmath89bar , @xmath90 m , and @xmath91 , with the imaginary part of the index of refraction decreasing from @xmath92 at 0.8@xmath13 m to 0.01 at 1.10@xmath13 m .\nthese parameters applied to model b with a metallicity of [ m / h]=@xmath93 result in the fit shown in figure 7 .\nthe metallicity of the atmosphere [ m / h ] is largely independent of the dust parameters , however , as it is constrained by the amplitude of the features in the h@xmath8o band which we fit between 0.925 and 0.98@xmath13 m . a larger metallicity results in a larger amplitude of the features inside the band .\nwe obtain the same value of [ m / h ] as long as a good fit of the `` continuum '' flux level is obtained , regardless of the particular values of dust parameters .\nthe lower panel of fig .\n7 clearly shows differences in the relative strengths of the absorption features in the h@xmath8o band between the synthetic and observed spectra .\nsimilar differences also occur in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .\nthe same differences are found for all three atmospheric profiles and point to inaccuracies in the oscillator strength of the ab initio line list of h@xmath8o @xcite .\nthe metallicity is fitted to give the best overall fit of these features with a precision of @xmath70 dex .\nstrictly speaking , this procedure gives the h@xmath8o abundance , or [ o / h ] rather than [ m / h ] .\nfor solar metallicity , the condensation of silicates deep in the atmosphere of gl 229b will reduce the amount of oxygen available to form h@xmath8o by @xmath94% @xcite which implies that @xmath95 } = { \\rm [ o / h ] } + 0.07.\\ ] ] the correction , which decreases for subsolar metallicities , is smaller than our fitting uncertainty and will be ignored hereafter .\nthe @xmath0 band spectrum probes the most transparent window of the spectrum of gl 229b and is formed at great depth where @xmath96k and @xmath97bar ( fig . 6 ) .\nour spectrum contains almost exclusively h@xmath8o features , with the exception of ch@xmath9 absorption for @xmath98 m and of two prominent k i lines ( fig .\nsince we have elected to ignore ch@xmath9 bands and our synthetic spectra do not include alkali metal lines , we fit the @xmath0 spectrum between 1.215 and 1.298@xmath13 m to determine the metallicity from the depth of the h@xmath8o absorption features .\nfigure 8 shows the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for model b. the flux level in the @xmath0 spectrum varies by a factor of 3 and our best fit shows distortions in the general shape of the spectrum .\nthe distortions may be caused by a combination of uncertainties in the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere , problems with the h@xmath8o opacities or a small amount of dust opacity in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the fit is based on the depth of the features , we ignore these distortions and fit the logarithm of the flux rather than the flux , as shown in fig .\n8 . as in the red spectrum (  5.1 )\n, we find a remarkable correspondence of spectral features between the observed and modeled spectra although the model spectrum is somewhat less successful at reproducing the relative strengths of the h@xmath8o features .\nwhile the @xmath1 band spectrum falls between the red side of a strong h@xmath8o band ( for @xmath22 m ) and the blue side of a prominent ch@xmath9 band ( for @xmath99 m ) , nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s have non - negligible opacity in this wavelength interval which also includes a band of co.    the strong ch@xmath9 band is responsible for the turnover of the flux at 1.59@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range ,\nthe ch@xmath9 opacity is described in our calculation by the @xcite laboratory measurements which are restricted to @xmath59k . as a consequence ,\nthe ch@xmath9 band comes in at 1.61@xmath13 m in the synthetic spectra , which results in strong departures of the mean flux level between data and models for @xmath100 m .\nthis limits our analysis of the @xmath1 band spectrum to wavelengths shorter than 1.58@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range ,\nthe spectrum is formed deep in the atmosphere , where @xmath101k and @xmath102 bar ( fig . 6 ) . within this spectral region ,\nwe determine the abundance of nh@xmath3 as a function of the metallicity , but can not untangle the two .\nwe also comment on the presence of h@xmath8s and co.      while nh@xmath3 absorption can significantly affect the slope of the spectrum shortward of 1.56@xmath13 m ( fig .\n9 ) , there is no distinctive feature at this spectral resolution ( @xmath103 ) to provide an unambiguous detection of this molecule .\nthe detection of co at 4.7@xmath13 m well above the equilibrium abundance @xcite suggests the possibility that nh@xmath3 may also depart from its chemical equilibrium abundance @xcite .\nwe therefore vary the abundance of nh@xmath3 by reducing its chemical equilibrium abundance  _ as computed for a given metallicity _  uniformly throughout the atmosphere by constant factor .\nwe found that reduction factors of 1 , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0 provide an adequate grid of nh@xmath3 abundances given the s / n ratio of the data and the residual problems with the h@xmath8o opacity .\nthe effect of varying the metallicity on the @xmath1 band spectrum is shown in fig .\n10 for model b. all spectra in figure 10 were computed with the equilibrium abundance of nh@xmath3 . in this case\n, we find a best fitting metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath104 .\nfigures 9 and 10 show that varying the abundance of nh@xmath3 and varying the metallicity have very similar effects on the synthetic spectrum . in the absence of any distinctive feature of nh@xmath3 ,\nit is not possible to determine both the metallicity and the nh@xmath3 abundance separately . for each value of [ m / h ]\n, we can adjust the nh@xmath3 abundance to obtain a good fit , higher metallicities requiring lower nh@xmath3 abundances .\nthe best fitting solutions are given in table 2 .\nthese fits are nearly indistinguishable from each other although the higher metallicity fits are marginally better .\nit is in the @xmath1 band that we find the poorest match in the detailed features of the data and the models . while the fit is determined by matching the relative amplitudes of the features , the two - parameter fit ( metallicity and nh@xmath3 abundance ) we have performed amounts to little more than fitting the slope of the spectrum . as an internal check on our fitting procedure and precision ,\nwe have have verified that our fits indeed have the same slope as the data by plotting data and models at a very low spectral resolution which eliminates all absorption features .\nhydrogen sulfide ( h@xmath8s ) has non - negligible opacity over most of the wavelength range of our fit to the @xmath1 band .\nfigure 11 shows two spectra computed with and without h@xmath8s opacity . its opacity is weaker than that of nh@xmath3 however , and there are no distinctive features which would allow a positive identification . since the h@xmath8s features are fairly uniformly distributed in strength and wavelength , fitting the spectrum with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of h@xmath8s or with no h@xmath8s at all only has a small - to - negligible effect on the determination of the nh@xmath3 abundance for a given metallicity ( table 2 ) .\nfor the low gravity model a , the nh@xmath3 abundance determined from spectra without h@xmath8s is about half of the value found with the chemical equilibrium abundance of h@xmath8s .\nthe difference decreases at higher gravities and is negligible for model c.    chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite indicate that h@xmath8s is present in gl 229b with an abundance essentially equal to the elemental abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere ( see  6.3 for further discussion ) .\nunfortunately , we are unable to ascertain the presence of h@xmath8s in the atmosphere of gl 229b at present .\nthe discovery of co in the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum of gl 229b with an abundance about 3 orders of magnitude higher than predicted by chemical equilibrium revealed the importance of dynamical processes in its atmosphere @xcite .\nthe 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum probes the atmosphere at the 2  3 bar level where @xmath105k ( fig .\n6 ) . at this level ,\nchemical equilibrium calculations predict a co abundance of @xmath106 while @xcite found @xmath107 .\nthe second overtone band of co falls within the @xmath1 band and , in principle , could provide a determination of @xmath108 at a deeper level of the atmosphere , where @xmath109 bar and @xmath110k ( fig . 6 ) .\nfigure 12 shows a comparison of the data with synthetic spectra computed with various amounts of co for model b with solar metallicity .\nthe first two spectra are computed with the chemical equilibrium abundance of co ( @xmath111 at 14@xmath10bar ) and without co ( @xmath112 ) .\nthese two spectra are very nearly identical .\na third spectrum is computed in the unrealistic limit where all the carbon in the atmosphere is in the form of co ( @xmath113 ) , which represents the maximum possible co enhancement . as we found for nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s\n, there is no distinctive spectral signature of co at this resolution ( @xmath103 ) .\nour extreme case represents a flux reduction of @xmath114 at best .\nwe are unable to constrain the co abundance with our data .\nsince the @xmath115 band of co is @xmath116 times weaker than the fundamental band at 4.7@xmath13 m , obtaining a useful co abundance from @xmath1 band spectroscopy will be a difficult undertaking .      of our three near infrared spectra\n, the @xmath2 band spectrum is formed highest in the atmosphere : @xmath117  1020@xmath10k and @xmath118bar ( fig .\nthis is the same level as is probed with 4.7@xmath13 m spectroscopy . as in the @xmath1 band ,\nthe spectrum contains mainly h@xmath8o features on the blue side ( @xmath119 m ) and a strong ch@xmath9 band appears at longer wavelengths .\nthere are also several nh@xmath3 features for @xmath120 m and the models predict an isolated feature of h@xmath8s ( fig .\n3 ) .    figure 13 compares a spectrum computed for model b with [ m / h]@xmath104 with the entire @xmath2 band spectrum .\nthere is an excellent agreement in the structure of the spectrum even though the overall shape is not very well reproduced . for @xmath120\nm , the model predicts strong features of nh@xmath3 which we discuss in the next section . beyond 2.12@xmath13 m\nis a ch@xmath9 band which is too weak in the model .\nthe structure within the modeled band is remarkably similar to the observed spectrum , however .\nthis much better agreement of the ch@xmath9 band than we obtained in the @xmath1 band is due to two factors .\nfirst , in this band the ch@xmath9 opacity is computed from a line list , and can therefore be computed as a function of temperature rather than at a fixed value of 300@xmath10k .\nsecond , the lower temperature where the band is formed ( fig .\n6 ) reduces the effect of the incompleteness of the ch@xmath9 line list above 300@xmath10k .\nnevertheless , we do not consider the ch@xmath9 features here and limit our analysis to @xmath121 m .\nthe @xmath2 band spectrum provides a unique opportunity : once the metallicity is determined by matching the depth of the h@xmath8o features between 2.05 and 2.10@xmath13 m , the abundance of nh@xmath3 can be obtained by fitting its features below 2.05@xmath13 m .\nthe fit of the metallicity is shown in fig .\n14 for model b , which shows [ m / h]=0 and @xmath40 ( top panel ) and our best fit , [ m / h]=@xmath93 ( bottom panel ) .\nvalues for models a and c are given in table 2 .\nall features in this region are due to h@xmath8o and , as we found in the red spectrum and in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , the oscillator strengths of the h@xmath8o line list do not reproduce the relative strength of the observed features very well .      in the wavelength range shown in fig .\n15 , the spectrum consists of a few nh@xmath3 features on a background of h@xmath8o absorption .\nsynthetic spectra predict seven strong nh@xmath3 features in this spectrum , three of which are clearly present ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) , one is absent ( 2.041@xmath13 m ) and three appear to be missing ( 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 m ) .\nthis constitutes an ambiguous detection of nh@xmath3 in gl 229b .\nthe determination of the abundance of nh@xmath3 from the @xmath2 band spectrum is hampered by the limited accuracy of the oscillator strengths of the h@xmath8o line list and by the incompleteness of our nh@xmath3 line list for temperatures above 300@xmath10k .\nthe effect of the former can be seen in the trio of features at 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 m , which overlap h@xmath8o absorption features . even after removing all nh@xmath3 opacity , these features are still too strong in the calculated spectrum ( top panel of fig .\nthe top panel of fig .\n15 as well as fig .\n13 show that for model b , the abundance of nh@xmath3 derived from the chemical equilibrium for the adopted metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath104 is too high .\nwe therefore consider a depletion in nh@xmath3 in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level probed by the @xmath2 band spectrum .\nfollowing the approach used in fitting the @xmath1 band spectrum , we express this depletion as a fraction of the chemical equilibrium abundance of nh@xmath3 for the metallicity obtained independently from the amplitude of the h@xmath8o features in the @xmath2 band .\nthis fraction is applied uniformly throughout the atmosphere for the computation of the synthetic spectrum .\ngiven the ambiguous presence of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band , we have determined the optimal nh@xmath3 abundance by minimizing the @xmath122 of the spectral fit for @xmath123 m .\nthis gives a depletion factor of @xmath124 with no nh@xmath3 present being an acceptable fit . restricting the fit to the region where nh@xmath3 features are clearly observed ( @xmath125 )\ngives a similar result but favors a finite value for the nh@xmath3 depletion of @xmath126 .\nthe results are summarized in table 2 .\nthe lower panel of figure 15 shows the model b fit obtained by reducing the nh@xmath3 abundance throughout the atmosphere to @xmath127% of its chemical equilibrium value _ for the adopted metallicity_. with this significant degree of depletion , the model reproduces the three detected features ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) extremely well and makes the 2.041@xmath13 m feature consistent with the observations .    because our nh@xmath3 line list is incomplete at high temperatures , the opacity which we compute is strictly a lower limit to the actual nh@xmath3 opacity at any wavelength .\nif the incompleteness is significant for the features found in the @xmath2 band spectrum , then the nh@xmath3 abundance is actually lower still .\nit appears extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h@xmath8o transitions would conspire to mimic the depletion of nh@xmath3 which we find .\nfor example , if we imagine that there is no nh@xmath3 depletion ( dotted curve in the top panel of fig .\n14 ) , the residuals between the data and the fitted spectrum for @xmath120 m would be much larger than the typical mismatch which we find in h@xmath8o features in all four spectra presented here .\nwe consider the depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band spectrum to be firmly established .\nwe are not able to establish the presence of h@xmath8s from our @xmath1 band spectrum (  5.3.2 ) . throughout the @xmath2 band ,\nthe h@xmath8s opacity is generally overwhelmed by h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 absorption .\nhowever , there is a peak in the opacity of h@xmath8s which is about one order of magnitude higher than all other opacity maxima ( fig .\nour synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to become visible in the midst of the background of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 features .\nfigure 17 shows the relevant portion of the @xmath2 band spectrum with synthetic spectra for all three models ( a , b , and c ) using the fitted metallicity ( table 2 ) .\nall three panels are remarkably similar .\nthe strength of the predicted feature is well above the noise level of the data , and taken at face value , figure 17 indicates a probable depletion of h@xmath8s by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand ,\nchemical equilibrium calculations indicate that the h@xmath8s abundance should be very near the elemental abundance of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical transport and condensation @xcite .\nsince there is no reason to expect a significant depletion of h@xmath8s , the discrepancy is probably due to remaining uncertainties in the opacities .\nour h@xmath8s line list is based on an ab initio calculation ( r. wattson , priv .\nwhich hasnt been compared to laboratory data in this part of the spectrum .\nthe strong feature centered at 2.1084@xmath13 m is a blend of three strong lines from three different bands of h@xmath8s .\npossible errors in the position or strength of these lines could significantly reduce the amplitude of the feature in our synthetic spectra .\nthe limitations of the background opacity of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 may also be responsible for the observed mismatch .\nnevertheless , it is desirable to look for this feature at a higher resolution and a higher s / n ratio as an absence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most intriguing result .      given our determination of @xmath14 and [ m / h ] in terms of the surface gravity , we can obtain the abundance of co from the 45@xmath13 m spectra of @xcite and @xcite which is consistent with our results .\nfor each model  a , b , and c  and using the metallicity given in table 2 , we computed synthetic spectra with various co abundances .\nthe latter is varied freely without imposing stoichiometric constraints .\nthe synthetic spectra are binned to the wavelength grid of the data and fitted to the data by a normalization factor adjusted to minimize the @xmath122 .\nthe @xmath122 of the fitted spectra shows a well - defined minimum as a function of the co abundance , @xmath108 ( table 3 ) .\nthe uncertainty on the co abundance is obtained by generating synthetic data sets by adding a gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best fitting model spectrum . after doing the same analysis on 1000 synthetic data sets ,\nwe obtain a ( non - gaussian ) distribution of values of @xmath108 .\nthe uncertainties given in table 3 correspond to the 68% confidence level .\nthe @xcite spectrum gives co abundances which are 0.1 dex higher than those obtained from the @xcite spectrum ; which is well within the fitting uncertainty .\n@xcite found a co mole fraction of 50 to 200 ppm ( @xmath128 ) by assuming a h@xmath8o abundance of 300 ppm ( effectively , [ m / h]@xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our result for model a which has [ m / h]@xmath130 .\nour results are also consistent with those of @xcite who find co abundances of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ppm ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) for [ m / h]=@xmath135 and 0 , respectively , using the data of @xcite .\nsince this part of the spectrum contains only h@xmath8o and co features , our fitting procedure is sensitive only to the co to h@xmath8o abundance ratio .\nchemical equilibrium calculations show that the h@xmath8o abundance scales linearly with the metallicity at the level probed with 45@xmath13 m spectroscopy ( _ i.e. _ all the gas phase oxygen is in h@xmath8o ) .\naccordingly , the co abundance we find scales with the metallicity of the model .\nas shown in figure 18 , the co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band corresponds approximately to the co / ch@xmath9 transition in chemical equilibrium .\nthe observations definitely exclude the very - low chemical equilibrium abundance of co. the fact that the extreme case where all carbon is co provides an acceptable fit to the data ( while we know that a good fraction of the carbon is in ch@xmath9 ) is due to the rather noisy spectra .\nit is highly desirable to restrict the surface gravity @xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful range .\nsince @xmath33 is known , a determination of @xmath27 fixes @xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig .\n4 ) , as well as the metallicity and the abundances of important molecules such as co and nh@xmath3 . the large uncertainty on @xmath27 results in a large uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and on the age of the system determined from cooling tracks .\nwhile a dynamical determination of the mass may be possible in a decade or so @xcite , a spectroscopic determination might be obtained much sooner .\nunfortunately , it is not possible to constrain the gravity better than @xmath136 with the data and models presently available .\nour high resolution spectroscopy does not allow us to choose between models a , b and c ( table 2 ) as an increase in gravity can be compensated by an increase in metallicity to lead to an identical fit .\nthe gravity sensitivity of the @xmath2 band synthetic spectrum models reported by @xcite occurs for a fixed metallicity only .\nsimilarly , @xcite and @xcite report that the spectral energy distribution of gl 229b models is fairly sensitive to the gravity .\nbut this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the three models indicated in fig . 4 , and using the metallicity we have determined for each ( table 2 ) the gravity dependence of the infrared colors is @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( table 4 ) .\nthis dependence is very weak in the light of the uncertainty in the photometry of gl 229b .\nmore problematic is the fact that the synthetic @xmath140 disagrees with the photometry .\nfurthermore , the incomplete ch@xmath9 opacities used in the spectrum calculation almost certainly result in an inaccurate redistribution of the flux in the near infrared opacity windows which determines the broad band colors .\nan example of this effect on the @xmath1 band flux can be seen in fig .\nwe conclude that a photometric determination of the gravity is not possible at present .\nan alternative approach to determining the gravity of gl 229b is through a study of the pressure - broadened molecular lines of its spectrum .\nthe spectrum of gl 229b is formed of a forest of unresolved molecular lines maily due to h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , and nh@xmath3 .\nbecause of the limitations of the ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 opacity data bases , a detailed study of molecular features is best performed in spectral domains where these two molecules do not contribute significantly to the opacity .\nspectroscopic observations with a resolution of @xmath141 can reveal the shape of individual h@xmath8o lines in regions where they are relatively sparse , _\ne.g. _ from 2.08 to 2.105@xmath13 m .\nour determination of the metallicity of gl 229b , with an uncertainty of @xmath70 , is given in table 2 for the three gravities considered .\nwe find an excellent agreement between our three independent determinations of [ m / h ] for each gravity and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be depleted in heavy elements , _ e.g. _ oxygen .\nthe metallicity is near solar at high gravity and decreases significantly for lower gravities . in their analysis of the `` red '' spectrum\n, @xcite found a h@xmath8o abundance between 0.3 and 0.45 of the solar value for a @xmath142k , @xmath50 model and they adopt a value of 0.25 in @xcite .\nmetal depletion in gl 229b is consistent with the analysis of the 0.985 \n1.02@xmath13 m feh band in the spectrum of the primary star gl 229a by schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) who find [ fe / h]@xmath143 .\nthe infrared colors of gl 229a imply that it is slightly metal - rich , however @xcite .\nthe relative metallicity of the components of this binary system may have been affected by their formation process .\nif the pair formed from the fragmentation of a collapsing cloud ( like a binary star system ) , the two objects should share the same composition .\nif the brown dwarf formed like a planet , from accretion within a dissipative keplerian disk around the primary , the selective accretion of solid phase material could lead to an _ enrichment _ in heavy elements compared to the primary star , as is observed in the gaseous planets of the solar system .\nthe low mass of the primary ( @xmath144 ) and the large semi - major axis and eccentricity ( @xmath145au and @xmath146 , @xcite ) suggests that the binary formation process , and therefore equal metallicities , are more plausible .\na more detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a is desirable to better understand the history of this system .\nthe results of our analysis of the metallicity and abundances of several molecules in the atmosphere of gl 229b are summarized in fig\neach panel corresponds to a different model ( see table 2 ) and shows the abundances of important molecules as a function of depth in the atmosphere based on chemical equilibrium calculations including condensation cloud formation .\nthe chemistry of these abundant molecules is fairly simple .\nthe abundance of h@xmath8o is uniformly reduced by @xmath147% by silicate condensation . except for a small depletion for @xmath148 due to the condensation of na@xmath8s\n, all sulfur is found in h@xmath8s .\nthe other molecules shown are not affected by condensation .\nnitrogen is partitioned between n@xmath8 and nh@xmath3 , with the latter being favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures .\nnh@xmath3 dominates near the surface and rapidly transforms into n@xmath8 at the higher temperatures found deeper in the atmosphere .\ndeep in the atmosphere , the higher pressures cause a partial recombination of nh@xmath3 and the ratio of the nh@xmath3 to n@xmath8 abundances increases slowly with depth . in a similar fashion ,\nall elemental carbon is found in ch@xmath9 at the surface but co starts to form at higher temperatures and rapidly becomes the most abundant carbon - bearing molecule .\nthe formation of co consumes h@xmath8o , as can be seen in fig .\n18 .    in each panel\n, a dotted box indicates the co abundance we have determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum , the location of the box along the ordinate shows the level probed at this wavelength ( fig .\n6 ) . as originally discussed by @xcite and @xcite ,\nthe co abundance is @xmath149 orders of magnitude larger than the chemical equilibrium value .\nstochiometric constraints imply that this also results in a significant reduction of the ch@xmath9 abundance at the 870  950@xmath10k level in gl 229b . in model b ,\nthe equilibrium abundance of ch@xmath9 at 900@xmath10k is @xmath150 , which corresponds to the abundance of elemental carbon .\nthe co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band is @xmath151 ( with a large error bar ) .\nconservation of the total number of carbon atoms then requires that the ch@xmath9 abundance be @xmath152 , a full factor of 2 below the equilibrium abundance .\nif we use the lowest co abundance allowed by our analysis , a 25% reduction of ch@xmath9 relative to its equilibrium abundance at 900@xmath10k results .\ndepletion of ch@xmath9 at this depth is readily accessible spectroscopically in the 1.6 and 3.3@xmath13 m bands , and may also affect the 2.3@xmath13 m band if the non - equilibrium co abundance persists at higher levels ( fig .\nafter h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 is the most important near infrared molecular absorber in gl 229b .\naccurate modeling of the spectrum demands a careful treatment of the non - equilibrium ch@xmath9 abundance .\nsimilarly , solid boxes show the nh@xmath3 abundance determined from our @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra .\nwhile the @xmath1 band abundance is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium value , there is a clear depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band .\nthe @xmath1 and @xmath2 band abundances are marginally consistent with each other but it appears that the nh@xmath3 abundance decreases upwards through the atmosphere .\nprocesses which take place faster than the time scale of key chemical reactions can drive the composition of the mixture away from equilibrium .\nthe case of co / ch@xmath9 chemistry has been well - studied in the atmosphere of jupiter where an overabundance of co is also observed .\ncarbon monoxyde is a strongly bound molecule and the conversion of co to ch@xmath9 through the ( schematic ) reaction @xmath153 proceeds relatively slowly , while the reverse reaction is much faster .\nvertical transport , if vigorous enough , can carry co - rich gas from deeper levels upwards faster than the co to ch@xmath9 reaction can take place .\nthe co / ch@xmath9 ratio at any level is fixed ( `` quenched '' ) by the condition @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the chemical reaction time scale and @xmath156 the dynamical transport time scale .\nwherever @xmath157 in the presence of a vertical gradient in the equilibrium abundance , non - equilibrium abundances will result .    as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and references therein )\n, this naturally explains the very high co abundance observed at the 900@xmath10k level . in this picture ,\nco - rich gas would be carried upward from @xmath158k .\nconvection is the most obvious form of vertical transport in a stellar atmosphere but in gl 229b the convection zone remains about 3 pressure scale heights below the level where co is observed ( shaded area in fig .\nperhaps convective overshooting can transport co to the observed level .\n@xcite propose `` eddy diffusion '' as a slower , yet adequate transport mechanism .\nthe eddy diffusion ( or mixing ) time scale is constrained by the poorly known co abundance and the somewhat uncertain chemical pathway between co and ch@xmath9 . from @xcite\n, we infer that @xmath159 to 10 years and could be much smaller .    in analogy to the co / ch@xmath9 equilibrium , a low nh@xmath3 abundance can be explained by vertical transport which can quench the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio at a value found in deeper layers in the atmosphere . as it is carried upward ,\nn@xmath8 is converted to nh@xmath3 by the reaction @xmath160 the n@xmath8 molecule is very strongly bound , however , and this reaction proceeds extremely slowly at low temperatures , much more slowly than reaction ( 2 ) .\nthermochemical kinetic calculations of the chemical lifetime for conversion of n@xmath8 to nh@xmath3 were performed as described in @xcite . the time scale for reaction ( 4 ) along the @xmath71 profiles of models a , b , and c and for @xmath161bar is given by @xmath162 where @xmath155 is in year , @xmath163 is the temperature in k , and @xmath27 is the surface gravity in cm / s@xmath164 .\nthis time scale assumes that the n@xmath8 conversion occurs in the gas phase although it could possibly be shortened by catalysis on the surface of grains .\nthe time scale increases very steeply with decreasing temperature . at the level probed in the @xmath1 band , @xmath165 and @xmath166 and in the @xmath2 band , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ! at some intermediate level ( which depends on @xmath27 ) , the time scale for the conversion of n@xmath8 into nh@xmath3 becomes longer than the age of gl 229b .\nin view of the relatively very short mixing time scale inferred from the co abundance , it follows that the nh@xmath3 abundance in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands is _ entirely _ determined by non - equilibrium processes , _ not _ by reaction ( 4 ) . at depths\nwhere @xmath169 ( which corresponds to the top of the convection zone ) , @xmath170yr and the reaction proceeds fast enough to establish chemical equilibrium between nh@xmath3 and n@xmath8 .\nwe therefore expect that the n@xmath8/nh@xmath3 ratio will be quenched at its value at @xmath171 , throughout the remainder of the atmosphere . while the time scale for eddy diffusion increases in the upper levels of the atmosphere , the extremely long @xmath155 ensures that the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio remains unchanged , regardless of how slowly the vertical mixing proceeds . for model\nb , this corresponds to @xmath172 , in perfect agreement with the abundance found in the @xmath1 band ( fig .\n18b ) .    while the abundance of nh@xmath3 determined from the @xmath2 band spectrum is not very precise , it is marginally consistent with vertical mixing\nfigure 18 shows that it is more likely that the @xmath2 band abundance is smaller than found in the @xmath1 band , however . on the other hand , the abundances shown in fig .\n18 and table 2 are depletion factors which were applied uniformly to the chemical equilibrium abundance profile of nh@xmath3 , which has a large vertical gradient . for consistency with the mixed atmosphere picture ,\nwe have therefore redetermined nh@xmath3 abundances using a constant abundance throughout the atmosphere and found @xmath173 and @xmath174 from the @xmath2 and @xmath1 band spectra , respectively ( model b ) .\nthe former is in good agreement with our simple prediction while the @xmath1 band value is now rather high .\nthe discrepancy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band results thus persists in this new analysis .\nchanges in [ m / h ] within the @xmath70 uncertainty have little effect either .\nwe consider the possibility that this vertical gradient in the nh@xmath3 abundance may be caused by a different non - equilibrium process such as the photolysis of nh@xmath3 by the uv flux from the primary star .\nammonia is a relatively fragile molecule which is easily dissociated by uv photons : @xmath175 with a photodissociation cross section of @xmath176cm@xmath164 per molecule , optical depth unity for the photodissociation of nh@xmath3 is reached at pressures of a few millibars in gl 229b .\nphotodissociation of the much more abundant h@xmath8 molecules does not effectively shield nh@xmath3 from incoming uv photons since the two molecules absorb over different wavelength ranges .\nphotodissociation of nh@xmath3 therefore represents a net sink of nh@xmath3 which occurs at the very top of the atmosphere .\nwe can estimate a lower limit to the time scale of photodissociation of nh@xmath3 by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of a nh@xmath3 molecule .\nthe incident photon flux is @xmath178 where photons causing dissociation of nh@xmath3 are between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 is the flux at the surface of the primary star , @xmath182 the radius of the primary star and @xmath79 the separation of the binary system . for nh@xmath3\n, we have @xmath183  and @xmath184  ( moses , priv . comm . ) .\nthe primary star has a dm1 spectral type , with @xmath185erg@xmath10@xmath186s@xmath88@xmath46 and @xmath187 cm @xcite .\nthe binary separation is @xmath188au @xcite .\nthis results in @xmath189@xmath186s@xmath88 .\nphotodissociation will affect significantly the nh@xmath3 abundance when @xmath190 where @xmath84 is the column density of nh@xmath3 . because the incident flux of uv photons is fairly low ,\nthis condition is satisfied only at pressures below a few microbars , _ i.e. _ very high in the atmosphere . in the region of interest\n, photodissociation destroys a very small fraction of nh@xmath3 during one mixing time scale and therefore has little effect on the abundance of nh@xmath3 .\nphotolysis of nh@xmath3 can not explain the relatively low nh@xmath3 abundance we find in the @xmath2 band spectrum .\nwe believe that the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band determinations of the nh@xmath3 abundance arise from the limitations of the nh@xmath3 opacity data used for the calculation of the synthetic spectra . as discussed above , the incompleteness of the nh@xmath3 line list for @xmath66k results in upper limits for the nh@xmath3 abundances obtained by fitting the data .\nsince this effect increases with temperature , we expect that the abundance determined from the @xmath1 band spectrum is overestimated relative to the one obtained from the @xmath2 band spectrum , which is what we observe .\nuntil nh@xmath3 opacities become available for @xmath191  1200@xmath10k , we will not be able to quantify this effect .\nfigures 6 and 18 show that ammonia offers a third window of opportunity for a determination of its abundance .\nthe region between 8.3 and 14.4@xmath13 m is rich in strong nh@xmath3 features , the two strongest being at 10.35 and 10.75@xmath13 m ( fig .\nthis spectral region probes a higher level in the atmosphere ( @xmath192k ) where the hot bands of nh@xmath3 which are missing from opacity data bases are less problematic than in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . in this spectral region ,\nthe spectrum is very sensitive to the nh@xmath3/h@xmath8o ratio , especially for nh@xmath3 abundances below 25% of the equilibrium value ( fig .\nthis would allow a good determination of the degree of nh@xmath3 depletion in the upper levels of the atmosphere .\nwe anticipate that 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy should reveal a nh@xmath3 abundance of @xmath193% of its equilibrium value .\nwith the availability of extensive photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic data , our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b is gradually becoming more exotic and more complex .\nthe initial discovery of ch@xmath9 in its spectrum set it appart and has prompted the creation of a new spectral class , the t dwarfs .\nh@xmath8o , co , cs i , and k i have also been detected .\nthere is good evidence that the rapid decrease of the flux at visible wavelengths is caused by unprecedently broad lines of atomic alkali metals @xcite .\nthe presence of condensates may also play a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b .\nit is unfortunate that the surface gravity of gl 229b remains poorly constrained .\nwe have not been able to further restrict the allowed range with our new @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectroscopy . as a result ,\nall our results are expressed as a function of gravity .\nthis is the most significant obstacle to further progress in elucidating the astrophysics of this t dwarf .\nthe surface gravity can probably be determined from the study of the pressure broadened shape of molecular lines .\nwe have found good evidence for the presence of nh@xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was expected from chemical equilibrium calculations .\nwe have been able to determine its abundance at two different levels in the atmosphere , and we find a significant deviation from chemical equilibrium .\na similar situation has been found with co previously @xcite and this abundance pattern can be explained by vertical mixing in the atmosphere .\nthe extent of the convection zone is not sufficient to account for the abundances we find and the mixing may be due to overshooting or to less efficient eddy diffusion . we find that nh@xmath3 photolysis is not important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh@xmath3 can be observed in three different bands corresponding to three distinct depths in the atmosphere , an accurate determination of its abundance in each band provides information on the time scale of mixing as a function of depth .\nthis is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can provide valuable clues for modeling the vertical distributions of possible condensates . in principle , any absorber with a large abundance gradient through the visible part of the atmosphere can be used to infer the details of the mixing process . among detected and abundant molecules , only co and nh@xmath3\nsatisfy this criterion .\nchemical equilibrium calculations with rainout of condensates @xcite show that we can expect significant vertical gradients in the abundances of atomic k , rb , cs , and na as they become bound in molecules ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na@xmath8s , respectively ) in the cooler , upper reaches of the atmosphere .\ncesium and potassium have been detected in the spectrum of gl 229b , and resonance doublets of k\ni and na i appear to shape the visible spectrum .\nhowever , the chemical timescales for alkali metals are so short that they should always remain in thermodynamic equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) .\ntherefore , they can not serve as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b .\nfurther progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b requires better opacities for ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of h@xmath8o .\na more accurate determination of the co abundance from 4  5@xmath13 m spectroscopy is very desirable and will require higher signal - to - noise spectroscopy than is currently available .\nsimilarly , 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the nh@xmath3 abundance for @xmath194bar , while difficult , is important .\nthe issue of vertical mixing and departures from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we consider that the observed departure of co from chemical equilibrium implies a significantly reduced ch@xmath9 abundance , by conservation of the abundance of elemental carbon .\nsimilarly , our results imply that nh@xmath3 absorption in the 10@xmath13 m region is reduced .\nbecause ch@xmath9 is a significant absorber in the near infrared , as is nh@xmath3 in the 10@xmath13 m range , departures from equilibrium must be taken into account when accurate modeling of the atmosphere and spectrum of gl 229b is desired .\nthis new level of complexity compounds the exoticism and the challenges posed by t dwarfs .\nthe astrophysics of gl 229b is far richer than has been originally anticipated .\ngl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to be in a binary system .\nthere is no evidence that the illumination from the primary star has a significant effect on the state of its atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely typical of isolated t dwarfs .\nit remains the brightest and by far the best studied of the seven t dwarfs currently known , but the list should expand to several dozens during the next 2  3 years @xcite .\nthe existing body of work on gl 229b points to the most rewarding observations to conduct on t dwarfs .\nthe possibility of studying trends in the physics of t dwarf atmospheres as a function of effective temperature is a fascinating prospect .\nwe
