    "article": "the low - energy effective theory describing the dynamics of a collection of wrapped d - branes at small separations is given by quiver quantum mechanics @xcite .\nthese d - branes form bound states and , depending on parameters , can either be well separated or on top of each other . when well separated , the theory is on the coulomb branch , parametrized by a macroscopic vev @xmath2 for the fields describing the separation between the branes .\nconversely , when the branes are on top of each other , the theory is on the higgs branch , parametrized by a large vev @xmath3 for the field representing the light stretched string mode between the branes .    in this paper we will consider the simplest example of quiver quantum mechanics , describing the dynamics of a pair of d - branes with a single light stretched string mode between them . being a supersymmetric theory ,\nthe relative separation between the branes lives in a vector multiplet @xmath4 and the lightest stretched string mode lives in a chiral multiplet @xmath5 .\nthese models have proven fruitful playgrounds for the study of supersymmetric black hole bound states at weak coupling @xcite .\nhowever , one obvious question remains unsolved : what is the structure of the bound state wavefunctions ? while supersymmetry allows us to make some statements about the structure of the ground states , the full ground state wavefunctions remain unknown @xcite .\nthis is because , while simpler than the full schrdinger equation , the bps equations remain too difficult to solve analytically .\nthe situation is worse for the excited states , where we have to abandon the crutch of supersymmetry altogether .\nit is our interest in this paper to construct the bps and excited states of this model .\nwe will not be able to do so analytically , but there exist numerical methods to compute the eigenspectra of differential operators on a finite domain , see e.g. @xcite . using these techniques\nwe numerically solve the schrdinger equation , plot bound state wavefunctions , and determine their energies . in our analysis , we find that the physics is governed by a dimensionless quantity @xmath1 defined in ( [ nu ] ) , which is inversely proportional to the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 .\nthe quantity @xmath1 dictates whether the higgs branch or the coulomb branch is the dominant description of the dynamics . in studying the wavefunctions and their dependence on @xmath1\n, we uncover that the two branches never quite decouple and the wavefunction has nonzero support in both branches for any value of @xmath1 .\nsince this model is supersymmetric , much work has gone into studying features of the ground states .\nfor example , the ground state wavefunction was previously studied in a born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , which involves splitting the hamiltonian @xmath7 into a vector part @xmath8 and a chiral part @xmath9 and putting the chiral degrees of freedom in the harmonic oscillator ground state of @xmath9 .\none then ` integrates out ' the chiral multiplet and solves the effective supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the vector multiplet degrees of freedom .\nthis approximation is self - consistent if we are on the coulomb branch , that is if the ground state is such that the branes are well separated , and is only valid for large values of @xmath10 .\none easy way to see this is that integrating out the chiral degrees of freedom generates a nontrivial metric on the moduli space of the vector multiplet , which appears in the effective lagrangian as @xmath11 the moduli space metric is singular at the origin where the approximation breaks down .\nthe structure of the ground state wavefunction near the origin has previously been out of reach , and herein we fill this gap .\ninterestingly the effective quantum mechanics on the coulomb branch of this model has an enhanced symmetry , allowing for a full determination of the spectrum on the coulomb branch @xcite . in computing excited state wavefunctions\nwe numerically compute the energy gap between the supersymmetric ground state and the first excited state as a function of @xmath1 .\nwe verify that the gap approaches the analytically determined value on the coulomb branch as we increase @xmath1 .\nrecently @xcite the witten index @xmath12 , twisted by a combination of global symmetries , has been computed for various quivers ; and for the model of interest in this paper , @xmath13 ( depending on the sign of the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 ) . we indeed find a single bosonic ground state in the correct representation of the global symmetry , meaning our result can be thought of as the first _ in silico _ experimental confirmation of the mathematically predicted bps spectrum of the model .\nmoreover , using the methods described in this note we have access to more than the count of bps states .\nthis includes plots of the ground state and excited state wavefunctions , the gap with the first excited state as well as various field expectation values .\nthe numerical methods we describe will hopefully make the study of the quantum nature of weakly coupled black hole bound states more tractable , and can potentially provide a useful experimental testing ground for other witten index calculations .\nthe organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ setup ] we present the supercharges and symmetry generators of the theory .\nthese fix the wavefunctions up to their dependence on radial variables .\nwe also give a quick review of the stringy interpretation of this model . in section [ groundstatesec ]\nwe provide the bps equations obeyed by the ground state wavefunction , suitably reduced via symmetries .\nwe also plot numerical solutions ( bps and non - bps ) for the full schrdinger problem in the singlet sector of the bosonic symmetry group .\nwe study the dependence of the bps and non - bps wavefunctions on @xmath1 .\nwe conclude in section [ outlook ] .\nwe have collected formulae in appendices [ sphereapp ] and [ wavefunceqs ] and review the born - oppenheimer approximate ground state wavefunction in appendix [ boapp ] .\nin this paper we focus on the @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum mechanics defined by the following four supercharges :

} \\ ] ] we will discuss the stringy origin of this quantum mechanics in section [ stringy ] , and refer the reader to @xcite for a more in depth treatment .\nthe lagrangian of the model can also be found in @xcite . in the above expressions ,\nthe @xmath15 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath16 .\nthis quantum mechanics arises as the dimensional reduction of a @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 gauge theory coupled to chiral matter@xcite .\nthe matter content therefore includes a vector multiplet @xmath4 and a chiral multiplet @xmath5 , along with its complex conjugate . nor @xmath20 appear in the supercharges .\nthis is because they are replaced by their on - shell values , e.g. @xmath21 and @xmath22 , when going to the operator formalism .\nthe model under consideration has no superpotential and hence @xmath23 . ]\nthe constant @xmath6 is a fayet - iliopoulos parameter .\nthe triplet @xmath24 transforms as a vector under @xmath25 rotations .\nthe @xmath26 @xmath19 gauge connection @xmath27 is non - dynamical and thus neither appears in the supercharges nor in the hamiltonian .\nhowever , as is manifestly the case in the lagrangian formulation of this theory , the chiral fields are charged under @xmath27 , and therefore @xmath27 generates a gauss - law constraint , which will appear in the algebra below .\nthe two - component chiral fermion @xmath28 and gaugino @xmath29 obey the canonical quantization conditions : @xmath30 we have borrowed the notation of @xcite where spinors with an index down transform in the @xmath31 of @xmath25 and spinors with an index up transform in the @xmath32 .\nindices are raised and lowered using the levi - civita symbol @xmath33 with @xmath34 .\nthus in our conventions :\n@xmath35 whenever spinor indices are suppressed it indicates that they are summed over .\nthe supercharges ( [ q]-[qb ] ) satisfy the supersymmetry algebra @xmath36 with hamiltonian @xmath37 the operator @xmath38 generates the gauss - law constraint , and must vanish on gauge - invariant states .\nappears in the supersymmetry algebra with the normal ordering constant @xmath39 , which is not present in the classical generator .\n] thus , the proper supersymmetric states of the theory satisfy the following bps equations @xmath40 let us briefly list the dimensions of the parameters and fields in units of the energy @xmath41 $ ] .\nthey are

.\nan important role will be played by the dimensionless quantity @xmath48 which we note here for later use .\nthe symmetry group of this theory is @xmath49 @xcite and the states fall into representations of this symmetry group .\nwe will use this to our advantage .\nthe generator of @xmath50 is the angular momentum operator : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the usual orbital angular momentum , which is not independently conserved .\nthe components of @xmath53 satisfy the following algebra : @xmath54=i\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\,\\mathbf{j}^k~ , & & \\left[\\mathbf{j}^i ,

jalg ] ) implies @xmath56=0 $ ] as promised .    the @xmath57 generator identitcal chiral multiplets labeled by the index @xmath58 then the @xmath59-charge operator would take the form @xmath60with the @xmath61 an arbitrary set of numbers . since herein we are considering the case @xmath62 ,\nthe term proportional to @xmath63 is simply @xmath64 and shifts the @xmath59-charge operator by the constant @xmath63 on gauge - invariant states , hence we set @xmath65 . ]\n@xmath66 satisfies

@xmath68=0 $ ] . notice that the conserved @xmath59-charge counts the difference in the number of gauginos and chiral fermions , while the fermion number @xmath69 is not conserved as a result of the mixing term in ( [ ham ] ) .\nthe hamiltonian is also invariant under the following discrete symmetry : @xmath70 which takes @xmath71 . as a result\nthe spectrum is degenerate under the interchange @xmath72 , and we verify this explicitly in appendix [ wavefunceqs ] .\nthis simple quantum mechanical model can be understood as the dimensional reduction of the worldvolume gauge theory living on a pair of wrapped d - branes in a calabi - yau compactification down to four dimensions .\nwe consider here only the relative gauge group between the branes and ignore the `` center of mass '' degrees of freedom as they play no role in the study of the bound states .\nthe vector muliplet scalars @xmath10 parametrize the separation between the d - branes in the non - compact space . furthermore , in our particular setup , the two branes intersect at a single point in the calabi - yau , where there exists a stretched string between them @xcite .\nthe lightest string excitation is parametrized by the bifundamental charged chiral multiplet and the chiral scalar mass can be read off from the classical potential @xmath73 that is @xmath74  .\nthe quantity @xmath75 should be understood as the difference between the phases of the complexified masses of the d - branes in the language of the calabi - yau compactification .\nthus , having neglected the tower of higher string modes , this model is only valid as an approximation to the d - brane system when @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the the string length ( see @xcite for an in - depth discussion as well as @xcite for earlier references ) .    an important role is played by the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 , which determines whether or not supersymmetry is broken , as is evidenced in ( [ potential ] ) . for @xmath79 there are two types of classical minima : the higgs branch with @xmath80 ( modulo @xmath19 gauge transformations ) , which preserves supersymmetry ; and the coulomb branch with @xmath81 , where supersymmetry is classically broken .\nthe potential has a flat direction when @xmath82 for which @xmath83 .\nthus for @xmath79 the model is expected to have bound states with energies below this threshold value of @xmath84 .\nfor @xmath85 there is no higgs branch and the coulomb branch is metastable for all values of @xmath86 .\nthis picture changes drastically ( for @xmath79 ) when quantum effects are taken into consideration .\nif we are interested in the large distance behavior of the wavefunctions of this model , that is @xmath87 , then the chiral multiplet can be integrated out ( see appendix [ boapp ] ) generating an effective potential on the vector multiplet @xmath88 the new effective potential has a zero energy minimum at @xmath89 and supersymmetry is restored on the coulomb branch . for the coulomb branch description to be consistent\nwe thus need @xmath90 or , restated in the language of the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 given in ( [ nu ] ) : @xmath91 for @xmath92 the bps wavefunction is localized on the higgs branch and the coulomb branch description is no longer valid . for @xmath1\nsufficiently large we expect the quiver description to break down and for supergravity to become the valid description @xcite .\nthus , in this model @xmath1 plays the role of the closed string coupling @xmath93 .\nsince this model is a dimensionally reduced worldvolume gauge theory , the mass @xmath94 of the vector multiplet is related to the closed string coupling @xmath95 .\nit is our interest in this paper to study how the quantum states of this quiver model depend on @xmath1 . in quantum mechanics\nthe higgs and coulomb branches are not fully separate , and the wavefunction will always have support in both directions .\nwe aim to answer how the majority of the wavefunction s support moves from the @xmath96 direction to the @xmath86 direction as @xmath1 is increased . in order to study this\nwe resort to numerically solving the full schrdinger equation and obtain supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric wavefunctions .\nthis also serves as a numerical check of known supersymmetric index calculations @xcite . in doing\nso we also gain insight into the excited state spectrum of the theory and show how the gap with the first excited state depends on @xmath1 .\nwe wish to diagonalize the maximal set of mutually commuting operators : @xmath97 and @xmath98  . before doing so , it is convenient to introduce the following parametrization for the chiral bosons : @xmath99 derivatives with respect to @xmath100 and @xmath101 are now given by @xmath102 and the gauss law generator becomes @xmath103 we will also find it convenient to work in spherical coordinates for the vector multiplet degrees of freedom , that is @xmath104\n. details on how operators are represented in spherical coordinates are given in appendix [ sphereapp ] .\nlet us first attempt to solve the bps equations ( [ bpseqs ] ) for the ground state wavefunctions of this model .\nusually this would involve applying the supercharges to a generic state and looking for the normalizable solutions .\nit is to our advantage , however , that the refined supersymmetric index @xcite @xmath105 has been computed for this system and evaluates to @xmath106 when @xmath79 .\nas @xmath6 goes from negative to positive , @xmath12 jumps to zero and provides the simplest example of wall crossing @xcite . since @xmath12 is independent of @xmath107 there exists a single bosonic ground state with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .\nthe most general gauge - invariant , @xmath59-symmetric wavefunctions take the form :- charge sectors to appendix [ wavefunceqs ] . ]\n@xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath20 are functions of @xmath113 .\nwe now further restrict to an @xmath50 highest weight state , which satisfies @xmath114 and @xmath115 , yielding in @xmath111 and @xmath20 as well as the factor of @xmath116 in @xmath20 for later convenience

e^{i\\varphi}\\sin\\vartheta\\,\\tilde{e}_{22}\\end{pmatrix}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath118 are also functions of @xmath119 .\nthe ground state has spin @xmath120 , meaning that @xmath121 also satisfies @xmath122 , which leads to the further simplification @xmath123 thus when @xmath120 , the matrix @xmath112 is simply @xmath124 demanding @xmath125 leads to the following set of coupled differential equations @xmath126 we can solve for @xmath127 and @xmath128 algebraically in favor of @xmath129 using ( [ e12eq1 ] ) and ( [ e12eq2 ] ) .\nexplicitly @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the classical potential , as in ( [ potential ] ) . making these substitutions , we find that @xmath129 statisfies the following schrdinger equation:-[e11eq2 ] ) is overdetermined but not inconsistent .\nsubstitution of ( [ frel ] ) and ( [ e11rel ] ) into both ( [ e11eq1 ] ) and ( [ e11eq2 ] ) gives rise to the same equation ( [ hardschro ] ) . ]\n@xmath132 as we will see in ( [ j0ham ] ) , this is precisely what we get out of the full schrdinger equation , but here the bps equations have provided us with expressions for @xmath127 and @xmath128 in terms of @xmath129 , and therefore a single un - coupled partial differential equation . were we able to solve ( [ hardschro ] ) , we would have an analytic expression for the bps wavefunction .\nthis has proven too difficult , so we instead solve for the ground state numerically . before moving on\nwe note that ( [ hardschro ] ) is very much akin to the ` deprolongation ' of the bps equations noticed in @xcite , namely we can rewrite ( [ hardschro ] ) as @xmath133 where we have implicitly defined the differential operator @xmath134 and @xmath135      to construct the ground state wavefunction numerically , we will input the full schrdinger problem into the mathematica s ndeigensystem command .\nthe coupled differential equations of interest ( see appendix [ r0eqsapp ] ) obtained from @xmath136 are : @xmath137 with @xmath138 as in ( [ laplaceop ] ) .\nwe have defined @xmath139 . by virtue of the bps equations ,\n@xmath140 in the ground state , but it does not necessarily vanish in the excited states .\nit turns out that @xmath141 satisfies the same wave equation as an @xmath142 state ( see for example ( [ hrm2 ] ) and ( [ hrp2 ] ) ) , hence states with vanishing @xmath141 have no superpartners in the @xmath142 sectors\n. the excited states with @xmath140 thus live in short multiplets , as described in appendix [ r0eqsapp ] .\nwe also note here that the norm of the @xmath143 wavefunctions is given by @xmath144 however , we will have to restrict the domain of @xmath145 and @xmath146 when computing the eigenfunctions of ( [ j0ham ] ) numerically , and the wavefunctions will be normalized on this restricted domain .\nwe are only interested in the case @xmath79 , since this is the phase with unbroken supersymmetry and relegate the study of @xmath6 positive to later work .\nthe procedure is as follows , we input the differential operator ( [ j0ham ] ) into mathematica s ndeigensystem command , which uses a finite element approach to solve for the eigenfunctions of a coupled differential operator on a restricted domain .\nwe vary the size of the domain and the refinement of the mesh until the numerics are stable .    before moving on\nwe pause here to discuss the the subtlety of diagnosing supersymmetry breaking in the presence of numerical errors . that is , it is naively quite difficult to tell the difference between an _ actual _ zero energy eigenstate and one whose energy is lifted by supersymmetry breaking effects , especially when the algorithm s resolution of the energy is @xmath147 ( as it can be in certain parameter regimes ) .\nthis is where being able to numerically determine the excited state spectrum comes in handy . to diagnose\nif supersymmetry is broken , it suffices to check that the state of interest lives in a supersymmetric multiplet and to find its susy partners .\nif the state in question is a singlet under supersymmetry , then supersymmetry is unbroken .\n( after integrating over the angular variables ) in the @xmath108 , @xmath120

support on the coulomb branch , that is near @xmath82 and @xmath176 . recall that the mass of @xmath100 is given by @xmath177 , so @xmath178 is precisely where @xmath100 becomes tachyonic .\nthe wavefunction s support on the coulomb branch grows as @xmath1 gets larger ( see figure [ probplot ] ) . notice how the ground state width in the @xmath96 direction increases as @xmath145 decreases .\nthis can be understood from the born - oppenheimer analysis , where the wavefunction has a factor @xmath179 .\nfor @xmath180 the higgs branch becomes important and the born - oppenheimer analysis breaks down .\nwe see that the width of the wavefunction in the @xmath96 direction grows greatly at this point .\n2 .   the excited state wavefunctions have considerably less support on the higgs branch than the ground state , and significantly more support on the coulomb branch than the ground state .\nthe component @xmath127 of the wavefunction only has support near @xmath165 .\nthis is expected from the born - oppenheimer analysis given in appendix [ boapp ] .\nboth @xmath20 and @xmath111 in ( [ r0wf ] ) can be understood as excited states of the chiral hamiltonian @xmath181 in ( [

support on the higgs branch to being supported mostly on the coulomb branch as we increase @xmath1 .\nthis is accompanied by an increasing vev for @xmath190 and a decreasing vev for @xmath191 .\nsince the ground state is nodeless , it must be the case that as @xmath1 is tuned larger ( @xmath192 tuned smaller ) , the peak of the wavefunction moves towards the origin and the tails spread out in the l - shape seen in figure [ wfcoulomb ] .\nthis smooth metamorphosis is accompanied by the bulk of the probability being localized at large values of @xmath145 . to make this quantitative , we compute the integrated probability @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the naive value of @xmath145 where the higgs branch becomes important , i.e. when the @xmath100 field becomes tachyonic .\nthe function @xmath195 is a diagonostic which tells us what fraction of the ground state wavefunction has support on the coulomb branch .\nwe have plotted it in figure [ probplot ] .    .\n, scaledwidth=52.0% ]    as expected @xmath195 increases monotonically as a function of @xmath1 . for @xmath1\nsufficiently large , the born - oppenheimer analysis , and the wavefunction given in appendix [ boapp ] capture the bulk of the large @xmath145 physics .\nin particular the energy gap and the expectation of @xmath190 match quite precisely with the coulomb branch formulae for @xmath196 , as shown in figure [ expectationvals ] .\nit is also of note that tuning the fayet - illiopoulos parameter near the wall of marginal stability at @xmath197 forces us into the large @xmath1 regime .\nhence to study wall crossing , one need only focus on the coulomb branch @xcite .\nof course , the higgs branch never fully decouples and the wavefunction will always have support there , it simply becomes less relevant as @xmath1 gets large as evidenced by the decreasing vev of @xmath198 .    for @xmath199 , there is no such decoupling , and we need to consider all degrees of freedom of the model .\nthis case can be very rich . in more complicated quiver models for example , where there can be multiple vector multiplets and a large number of chiral multiplets in play\n, one can consider tuning parameters such that some subset of chiral multiplets and vector multiplets are relevant .\nit was advocated in @xcite that such a mixed higgs - coulomb problem would be a toy model for studying a d - particle falling into a black hole . in that case , where we have little analytic control , numerics seems to be one avenue toward approaching this problem .\nthis seems exciting , as it would provide a numerical avenue towards testing the fuzzball proposal as advocated in @xcite .\nin this brief note we numerically constructed the bound state wavefunctions of a simple d - brane quiver quantum mechanics . in doing\nso we demonstrated how the ground state and excited states shuffle around as parameters are tuned .\nwe have also given a numerical - experimental verification of the witten index computed for this model @xcite .\nthis is an example of what may someday be commonplace \nan _ in silico _ approach to studying supersymmetric quantum systems .\napart from numerically verifying complicated witten index computations , one can also imagine , for example , revisiting old problems related to d0-brane matrix quantum mechanics @xcite such as the structure of the d0-brane bound state at small distance for fixed @xmath200 or a nonabelian quiver quantum mechanics at fixed but nonzero @xmath200 .\nthese systems have threshold bound states in the absence of fayet - iliopoulos parameters and we hope to report on whether numerics are useful in this scenario in a subsequent publication . another avenue is to study the states of mass deformed quiver theories recently described in @xcite , which represent the effective dynamics of wrapped branes in ads .\nthese questions are within reach using numerics .\nanother interesting future direction is to study the entanglement structure between the chiral and vector degrees of freedom .\ntypically when studying these models we have recourse to the born - oppenheimer approximation in which the chiral degrees of freedom are integrated out .\nas we mentioned , this integrating out generates a metric on the moduli space of the coulomb branch and it would be interesting to understand if this metric can be linked to the entanglement between the degrees of freedom .\nleft untouched of course is what happens for quiver models with more fields .\nit has been shown for example @xcite that a quiver with three nodes and a closed loop has an exponential number of ground states ( in the number of arrows ) .\nit was then argued in @xcite that these states are ` pure - higgs ' , in the sense that they have no analogue on the coulomb branch .\nthis seems to be in some tension with the notion that the ground states should morph smoothly as parameters are tuned , and that the wavefunction always has support in both the higgs and coulomb branch directions .\none can envision studying the three - node quiver numerically in order to get a handle of the relation between higgs branch and coulomb branch states in more complicated models .\nit is a pleasure to thank dionysios anninos , arjun bagchi , nikolai bobev , frederik denef , daniel z. freedman , jaehoon lee , hong liu , daniel mayerson , antonin rovai ,

applied to this state then reduces to @xmath224      the highest weight state in the @xmath226 sector takes the form @xmath227 the schrdinger equation @xmath228 applied to this state then reduces to @xmath229 this is the same equation as in the @xmath221 case , and we see that their spectra coincide as a result of the discrete symmetry ( [ discretesymm ] ) .\nthe highest weight state in the @xmath230 sector takes takes the form @xmath231 with @xmath232 and @xmath233 where we have included the factor of @xmath234 in @xmath235 to ensure that the restricted schrdinger equation , represented

satisfies the same differential equation as @xmath255 . unlike in the bps sector , where the equations implied strict equality , we can not immediately come to the same conclusion here .\nin fact , away from zero energy it is not always possible to argue that the functions should be equal .\nthe schrdinger equation implies that @xmath127 satisfies @xmath256 and similarly for @xmath254 .\nlet us assume that @xmath257  , then @xmath141 satisfies @xmath258 which is the restricted schrdinger equation of the @xmath142 sectors , which is expected to have non - zero solutions for certain @xmath259

the case the state @xmath121 will come in a multiplet that includes states with @xmath59-charge @xmath262 with the same spin @xmath260 . when @xmath140 , the multiplet containing @xmath121 does not contain states with @xmath263 and thus must be annihilated by the pair @xmath264 and @xmath265 .\nwhen this happens we refer to it ( in a slight abuse of terminology ) as a short multiplet .\nprevious treatments of this model have assumed a separation of scales between the chiral multiplet degrees of freedom and those of the vector multiplet @xcite . this is natural given the d - brane interpretation of the degrees of freedom , where the chiral fields represent stretched strings at the intersection points between the branes . when the branes are well separated , the chiral fields become effectively heavy and can be integrated out . in practice , we can study the effective interactions of the remaining degrees of freedom in a born - oppenheimer approximation .\nthis was explicitly done in @xcite and we repeat the analysis here .    the idea is to split the hamiltonian @xmath7 and the supercharges in powers of @xmath266 ( recall from ( [ ccrm ] ) that the gauginos come with an effective power of @xmath266 ) .\nthus we can write @xmath267 with @xmath268\\left(\\bar{\\psi}\\epsilon\\right)_\\gamma~,\\\\ q_\\alpha^{(1)}&\\equiv

@xmath272 .\nthe fermionic vacuum @xmath216 is annihilated by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .\nthere is some subtlety in the choice of @xmath275 , which we will come to shortly .\nnotice however that

@xmath289 .    the wavefunction @xmath290 in ( [ bototwv ] ) can be viewed as an expansion of the exact bps wavefunction in powers of @xmath266 @xcite .\nwe would like estimate how close the first order term @xmath291 is to the actual ground state of the theory .\nlet us do so by computing the expectation value of the total hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in this state .\nwriting @xmath292 and integrating over the angular variables reveals @xmath293 this quantity is logarithmically divergent at small @xmath145 .\nthe excited states of @xmath181 , which have energies @xmath294 , become relevant near the origin and can not be neglected .\nlet us address some well warranted objections \nafter all , the born - oppenheimer approximation is typically phrased as a variational problem whereby one tries to minimize the functional @xmath295 .\nthis is done in two steps , one first defines @xmath296 , with @xmath272 given by the ground state of @xmath181 , and then minimizes the functional @xmath297 over @xmath277 . instead of following this procedure , we computed the effective supercharges , and used their algebra to find @xmath298 given in ( [ hameff ] ) . the only way for a discrepancy to arise is if @xmath299 , which is indeed the case .\nnotice that @xmath300 , so terms proportional to the gauginos in ( [ hameff ] ) must come from higher order terms in perturbation theory , such as@xcite @xmath301 in conclusion , we have incorrectly dropped higher order terms in ( [ bototwv ] ) whose contributions to the total energy ( [ hameff ] ) come in at the same order in @xmath266 .\nthis is nicely explained in @xcite . to obtain ( [ hameff ] ) from the born - oppenheimer approximation without first computing the supercharges\n, one must include the higher order corrections in ( [ bototwv ] ) .\nthis will lead to coupled equations of the form @xmath302 , with @xmath303 some set of differential operators .\none then back - substitutes these expressions for the @xmath304 into the schrdinger equation for @xmath277 to find @xmath298 of ( [ hameff ] ) acting on @xmath277 .\nthis indicates that the born - oppenheimer approximation of the supersymmetric ground
