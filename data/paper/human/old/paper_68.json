    "article": "the unconventional superconductors have a rich phase diagram determined by the interplay of multiple competing , or coexisting , types of order .\nnematic order ( which breaks the c@xmath0 symmetry of the underlying square lattice down to c@xmath1 ) has been shown to emerge in certain regimes of the phase diagrams of the copper - oxide @xcite and the iron - based @xcite superconductors . in the latter case ,\nthe nematic order accompanies ( and in some cases , precedes ) the magnetic order which occurs at a wavevector that breaks the lattice rotational symmetry .\nrecently , the structure of the vortex cores in the mixed state of clean fese films was studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .\nstrong anisotropy was observed in the zero bias conductance map around the cores , which have an eccentricity of the order of unity .\nalthough the lattice structure of fese at low temperature is orthorhombic@xcite , it has been claimed @xcite that the crystalline anisotropy ( of the order of a few tenths of a percent ) is too small to explain the large anisotropy of the vortex cores , which is likely to have an electronic origin .\nthis experiment raises several questions , some of which we address in this paper : assuming that there is an electronic nematic order in superconducting fese , what is its microscopic origin ? what is its relation to superconductivity - _\n, are these two types of order competing ? is the nematic order localized in the vortex cores ( and hence stabilized by the application of the magnetic field ) , or does it extend throughout the system ( and is only apparent in the stm spectrum near the cores ) ?    here , we study the structure of the vortex core using a phenomenological landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory in terms of two competing order parameters . using our lg analysis\nwe have calculated the structure of an isolated vortex in the presence of the nematic order .\nour main result is that by looking at the profile of the gap near the vortex core , it is possible to distinguish between two different configurations of the nematic order , namely the presence of a localized nematic order within the superconducting vortex as opposed to the presence of a long range nematic order in the system .\nif the nematic order is localized at the core , the superconducting gap should be anisotropic only near the core and the anisotropy decays exponentially as we move away from the core .\non the other hand , if the nematic order is long - ranged , the superconducting gap should exhibit an anisotropy which decays as a power law .\nif the nematic order is near its critical point , there is a large region in which the anisotropy of the gap depends logarithmically on the distance , eventually crossing over to a power law .\nmoreover , we find qualitative differences in the shape of the contours of constant gap around the core in the different cases .\nif the nematic order exists only in the cores , the equal - gap contours tend to be elliptical ; if the nematic order is long - ranged , we find that the gap function tends to develop a `` four - lobe '' structure , with more pronounced higher harmonics .\nthese features can be sought in stm experiments by mapping the magnitude of the gap around the core as a function of position .\nthe paper is organized as follows : in section [ mod ] we introduce the lg functional with the two competing order parameters and carry out a preliminary analysis in the absence of the anisotropy . in section [ pd ] , we investigate the mean - field phase diagram of a single vortex . in section [ min ] , we introduce the anisotropy and perform a numerical minimization of the functional , commenting on the interesting features .\nfinally , in section [ anis ] , we present our analytical results explaining the various interesting features observed by minimizing the free energy .\nwe consider a lg type free energy for two competing order parameters : a complex field @xmath2 , describing the superconducting order parameter , and a real field @xmath3 , which describes a nematic order that competes with the superconducting order parameter .\nthe form of the free energy density is given by @xmath4+\\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{2}\\phi\\bigg[(\\partial_{x}\\phi)^{2}-(\\partial_{y}\\phi)^{2}\\bigg].\\label{glfun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from the standard free energy contributions arising due to @xmath3 and @xmath2 , we have a competition term , controlled by @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and a term that gives rise to different effective masses for @xmath2 in the two directions , which is controlled by @xmath7 .\n@xmath8 is invariant under a rotation by 90 degrees , represented by @xmath9 we will be interested in the limit of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the london penetration depth , so that we can neglect the coupling to the electromagnetic field . at the outset , we set @xmath12 , since the @xmath13 term is small compared to the @xmath7 term in the limit where @xmath3 is small .\nit is convenient to define the coherence length of @xmath2 and the healing length of @xmath3 as @xmath14 taking the unit of distance to be @xmath15 , we can recast the above free energy in a more transparent form as follows , @xmath16+\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{2\\gamma_{s}}|\\tilde{\\psi}|^{2}\\tilde{\\phi}^{2}\\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\lambda\\tilde{\\phi}[(\\partial_{\\tilde{x}}\\tilde{\\psi}^{*})(\\partial_{\\tilde{x}}\\tilde{\\psi})-(\\partial_{\\tilde{y}}\\tilde{\\psi}^{*})(\\partial_{\\tilde{y}}\\tilde{\\psi})],\\label{lgf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . from now on , we will drop the tilde symbols .    for @xmath21\n, a short - distance cutoff has to be imposed on eq .\n[ lgf ] . otherwise , the system is unstable towards developing modulations of @xmath22 with sufficiently short wavelength .\nwe discuss the instability in appendix [ appins ] . in practice\n, we will mostly ignore this issue , assuming that there is a short - distance cutoff ( which is provided by the finite grid used in our numerical calculations ) .\nbefore we begin our analysis , let us comment about the choice of parametrization in this problem .\nwe would like to think of this problem in terms of a fixed @xmath23 . then\non choosing a particular ratio of the length scales of @xmath3 and @xmath22 , we still have one degree of freedom left in terms of the masses or the stiffnesses of the two order parameters , which is fixed by tuning @xmath24 .    if we assume that @xmath25 , then the uniform ground state is given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .\nthis also constrains @xmath3 to be localized around the vortex cores , by making the mass term for @xmath3 positive deep inside the superconducting region .\nif we further assume that the nematic order is small , such that @xmath28 , then we can essentially ignore the feedback of @xmath3 on @xmath22 .\ntherefore , we will first find the full profile of @xmath29 , the isolated vortex solution , in the absence of the nematic order and use that to find the form of the nematic order .\nthen @xmath30 satisfies the following asymptotic relations :      where @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the radius in the original coordinate system , and @xmath34 is a dimensionless constant . in general , it is difficult to find the solution of the full lg equation for @xmath30 for all @xmath35 analytically .\ntherefore we obtain the vortex solution @xmath36 for all @xmath35 by minimizing the functional in eqn .\n[ lgf ] numerically in the absence of @xmath3 .\nthe numerical solution conforms to the two asymptotic expressions above .\nit is interesting to note that @xmath30 does not recover from the vortex core to its bulk value exponentially , but rather as a power law @xcite .\nthe behavior of @xmath37 in the vicinity of a vortex with @xmath38 was studied by ref .  .\nwe will now describe the mean - field phase diagram of a single vortex in the presence of a competing nematic order .\nthere are three possible phases : in phase i , @xmath27 everywhere ; in phase ii , @xmath3 vanishes at large distance from the vortex core but becomes non - zero near the vortex core due to the suppression of the competing @xmath22 field to zero at the core ; and in phase iii , @xmath39 even far away from the core . a non - zero solution for @xmath3 is favored whenever the smallest eigenvalue @xmath40 of the following eigenvalue problem @xcite : @xmath41^{2}\\bigg]\\phi\\left(x\\right)=\\epsilon\\phi\\left(x\\right ) , \\label{eigeqn}\\ ] ] satisfies @xmath42 . in order to find the phase diagram , we solve this eigenvalue problem numerically on a discrete grid .\nthe boundary between phases i and ii is the locus of points at which the smallest eigenvalue satisfies @xmath43 . for @xmath44 , @xmath3 becomes long - ranged , corresponding to phase iii . the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig . [ lvsg ] .\nthis phase diagram is strictly valid as long as @xmath45 .\nif this is not the case , then the state with uniform nematic background and no superconductivity is energetically favorable over any other state\n.     plane obtained by solving eqn .\n[ eigeqn ] numerically on a grid with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .\nthe regions with qualitatively different solutions for @xmath3 are marked .\nphase i has no nematic order with @xmath27 everywhere , phase ii has nematic order localized in the vortex core , and phase iii has long - range nematic order away from the core .\nthe blue squares correspond to points which we explore in more detail later .\nthe dashed line @xmath48 represents the boundary between phases ii and iii . ]    the physics behind the phase diagram can be understood as follows . when @xmath49 we are forcing the nematic order to coexist with superconductivity in a large region .\nthis is unfavorable energetically due to the competition term @xmath50 .\nwhen @xmath25 , there is no @xmath39 solution .\nif @xmath44 , @xmath3 becomes non - zero even far away from the vortex core . in the opposite limit of @xmath51 , the nematic order exists deep within the superconducting vortex .\nsince there is very little overlap between the two order parameters , the system can afford to have a higher value of critical @xmath24 below which there is a nontrivial nematic order .\nthis explains the increasing trend of the critical @xmath24 for decreasing @xmath52 .\n+ in the @xmath51 case , it is possible to give an analytical expression for the phase boundary between regions i and ii .\nthe equation for this curve is given by , @xmath53 where @xmath34 is the constant which appears in eqn .\n[ psi0as ] .\nthe details of this computation are diskussed in section [ phases ] .\nwe are now in a position to include the effect of the anisotropy and investigate the structure of the vortex cores in different regions of the phase diagram described above .\nwe now turn to diskuss the characteristics of the vortex profile in the different regimes shown in fig . [ lvsg ] . to solve for the vortex profile ,\nwe minimize the free energy ( [ lgf ] ) with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath3 numerically on a disk geometry .\nthis is equivalent to solving the coupled landau - ginzburg equations with neumann boundary conditions , as we diskuss in appendix [ boundary ] .\nmany of the features found in the numerical solution can be understood analytically , as we diskuss in the next section .\nwe can expand both @xmath22 and @xmath3 in terms of the different angular momentum channels ( @xmath54 ) .\nthe term proportional to @xmath55 only couples angular momentum channels that differ by 2 units of angular momentum in @xmath22 .\ntherefore , in the presence of @xmath3 , the bare vortex solution ( @xmath56 ) gives rise to components of the form @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc .\nsimilarly , the feedback of the superconducting order on @xmath3 gives rise to the generation of the even harmonics , i.e. @xmath59 gives rise to terms proportional to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .\nit is also possible to have a solution with only the even harmonics of @xmath22 , in which case , the vortex is absent .\nthese two solutions do not mix with each other and therefore we shall focus on the solution in the presence of the vortex . + in light of this , we expand the order parameters as @xmath62 in terms of the expansions in eqn .\n[ expan ] , the free energy density can be written as , @xmath63-\\frac{\\psi_{n}^{2}}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{n , p , q}\\psi_{n}\\psi_{n+p -

zero uniform @xmath72 away from the vortex core and a non - zero @xmath3 localized near the vortex core , decaying exponentially away from the core ( given that @xmath73 and @xmath25 ) .\nthe contour plot for @xmath74 is shown in fig .\n[ gam2l0p1 ] .\nthe parameters used here are @xmath75 .\nas can be seen in the figure , the core has an elliptical shape because of the interaction with the nematic order which coexists with superconductivity in the core region .\nas we go away from the core , the contours of equal @xmath74 become more and more isotropic , due to the rapid decay of the nematic order away from the core .\nthis region in the phase diagram corresponds to the case where there is a uniform nematic background coexisting with superconductivity , even away from the vortex core . in this regime , as we move away from the core , @xmath3 goes to a constant and @xmath22 remains anisotropic . in fig .\n[ gam0p5l0p5 ] , the harmonics @xmath76 and @xmath77 are almost constant for large @xmath35 .\nmoreover , @xmath78 for large @xmath35 . the contour plot of @xmath74 reveals a large anisotropic `` halo '' around the core , with a non - elliptical shape .    far away from the core , where @xmath3 is constant ,\nthe landau - ginzburg equations can be solved analytically , showing that the anisotropy in @xmath74 decays as a power law in this case .\nwe diskuss this solution in the next section .\nfinally , we diskuss the critical line separating regions ii and iii in fig .\n[ lvsg ] , in which the @xmath3 field is critical far away from the core .\nnaively , one would expect @xmath3 to go as @xmath79 asymptotically in this regime .\nhowever , depending on the details of the solution at small @xmath35 , there may be an intermediate regime in which @xmath80 , eventually crossing over to @xmath79 at a larger distance .\nthis feature is diskussed in more detail in the next section .\n[ gam1l3]a shows @xmath22 and @xmath3 in the critical regime , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . indeed , we observe that @xmath3 decays slowly away from the core .\n@xmath83 also have long tails .\nthe contour plot for @xmath74 shares features that are similar to the behavior in region iii , namely a long - range , non - elliptical anisotropic halo .\nit is shown in fig .\n[ gam1l3]b .    in the next section\n, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution in the critical case , showing that the anisotropic component of @xmath74 falls off as @xmath84 at intermediate @xmath35 , crossing over to @xmath85 at sufficiently large @xmath35 .\nin this section , we propose various analytical arguments to explain the different features that were observed above by carrying out the minimization numerically . in subsection [ phases ] , we diskuss the solution for the nematic order in the presence of superconductivity\n. then in subsection [ coex ] , we analyze region iii of the phase diagram ( fig .\n[ lvsg ] ) .\nfinally , in subsection [ lingl ] , we study the linearized gl equations in order to explain some of the other interesting features that were observed earlier .      here\nwe will briefly review the solution for @xmath3 , and supplement it with some further details .\nthe lg -

scale the coordinates as @xmath111 where @xmath112 , then this problem now becomes identical to the isotropic problem we had solved in the beginning of section [ mod ] .\nthe solution for @xmath30 can then be written in terms of the new coordinates as , @xmath113 note that due to the presence of the background nematic order , @xmath30 does not tend to @xmath114 asymptotically .\nwe now go back to our original coordinate system @xmath115 by expanding the above result to linear order in @xmath116 .\nthen we get , @xmath117 in the above expression , the first bracket corresponds to @xmath30 , the second bracket corresponds to @xmath77 while the last one represents @xmath76 .\nit is interesting to observe that asymptotically , @xmath76 and @xmath118 approach the same constant value .\nwe observe this feature in fig.([gam0p5l0p5]a ) .\nhowever , the harmonics do not recover to their asymptotic value as a power law , which is a result of the boundary conditions that were imposed while minimizing the free energy in the disk geometry ( see appendix [ boundary ] ) .    from eqn .\n[ psireg3 ] , we can evaluate the form of @xmath74 and find that , @xmath119 therefore , asymptotically , @xmath74 is isotropic and the anisotropy decays as @xmath120 .      in this section , we shall carry out an analysis of the linearized lg equations , to give an analytical explanation for some of the features that we have observed by carrying out the full minimization . for\nthe sake of simplicity , let us ignore the feedback on @xmath3 resulting in the generation of the higher harmonics and assume that @xmath3 is isotropic ( i.e. @xmath121 ) .\nthen , the linearized lg equations for the harmonics of @xmath22 can be written as , @xmath122\\nonumber \\\\\n+ \\lambda\\partial_{\\rho}\\phi(\\rho)\\bigg[\\bigg(\\partial_{\\rho}-\\frac{2n-1}{\\rho}\\bigg)\\psi_{n-1}(\\rho ) & + & \\bigg(\\partial_{\\rho}+\\frac{2n+3}{\\rho}\\bigg)\\psi_{n+1}(\\rho)\\bigg]\\label{harmonics_nd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are some features of the problem that can not be deduced from a study of the linearized version of the problem , which include the overall scale and sign of @xmath3 and the signs of the different harmonics of @xmath22 .    in the limit of @xmath86 ,\ni.e. inside the vortex core , at leading order @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .\nthis is a necessary condition for the harmonics to be well behaved in the limit of @xmath125 .    on the other hand , in the limit of @xmath97 , i.e deep inside the superconducting region , the homogenous solution for the above equation\ngives exponentially damped solutions for all the @xmath126 , i.e. the anisotropy is short ranged .\nmoreover , the source term , which is proportional to @xmath127 and is itself exponentially damped ( region ii ) , is also not strong enough to give rise to any long ranged solution .    however , when @xmath3 is critical ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , the source term leads to the presence of long tails in the harmonics . in the regime where @xmath3 falls off logarithmically\nwhile @xmath30 is a constant , at leading order @xmath83 just follow @xmath3 , i.e. they also fall off logarithmically ( with prefactors of equal magnitude but opposite sign ) and have a correction of the form @xmath128 . on the other hand , when @xmath3 crosses over to the power law form , at\nleading order @xmath83 also fall off as @xmath129 with a correction of order @xmath130 .\nwe have studied the interplay between nematic order and superconductivity in the presence of a vortex .\nif the nematic order coexists with superconductivity in the vicinity of a vortex core , the coupling between the two order parameters leads to an elongated shape of the core .\nwe diskuss two distinct scenarios : in one the nematic order coexists with superconductivity everywhere ( i.e. , even far away from the vortex core ) , whereas in the other the competition between the two order parameter suppresses the nematic order in the bulk , and nematicity only exists close to the core where the superconducting order parameter is diminished . both scenarios lead to an anisotropic core .\nhowever , we show that they can , in principle , be distinguished by the way the anisotropy of the superconducting gap decays away from the core .\nif the nematicity exists only near the core , the anisotropy in the superconducting gap decays exponentially ; if it exists throughout the sample , we expect the gap anisotropy to decay as @xmath131 , where @xmath33 is the distance from the core .\nmoreover , there are qualitative differences in the shape of the core in the two cases . in the former case , in which only the core region is nematic , the contours of equal gap tend to be more or less elliptical . in the latter case ,\nthe contours of equal gap tend to develop non - elliptical shapes with a four - petal pattern .\ntherefore , analyzing the gap profiles measured by stm around a vortex could reveal the nature of the nematic ordering - whether it is localized at the vortex core , or coexists with superconductivity in the bulk .\nso far , we have diskussed the structure of an isolated vortex at the mean - field level . however , if the nematic ordering is favored only within a vortex core , an isolated vortex can not have static nematic order , since either thermal or quantum fluctuations would destroy such order .\nstatic nematic order is only possible when the density of vortices is finite .\nthe coupling between the nematic halos of different vortices scales as @xmath132 $ ] , where @xmath133 is the inter - vortex distance ( @xmath134 is the applied magnetic field ) .\nthe system can be described by an effective two - dimensional transverse field ising model with a spin - spin interaction @xmath135 and a @xmath134-independent transverse field .\n( note that , unlike ref\n. @xcite , we are considering a thin film , rather than a three - dimensional system . )\nthis model has a nematic transition at a certain critical @xmath134 , which should be seen , e.g. , by measuring the anisotropy of the vortex cores as a function of @xmath134 .\nif an external rotational symmetry breaking field exists , as is presumably the case in fese due to the small orthorhombic lattice distortion@xcite , the electronic nematic transition is smoothed out . however , one still expects a sharp crossover as a function of magnetic field if the orthorhombic distortion is sufficiently weak .\nthe microscopic origin of the anisotropic vortex cores observed in fese@xcite remains to be understood .\nit is likely that it originates from electronic nematicity rather than from the lattice distortion , since the experimentally reported orthorhombic distortion seems too small to produce such a large effect .\nthe electronic nematic order could have an orbital character@xcite .\nalternatively , it could arise from a field - induced magnetic ordering@xcite at a wavevector @xmath136 or @xmath137 in the one iron unit cell , which is necessarily accompanied by a nematic component ( similar to the ordering in the iron arsenides ) .\nalthough static ordering of this type has not been observed in the iron selenides@xcite , it remains to be seen if they develop a static ordering in the presence of an applied magnetic field .\nneutron scattering experiments revealed a magnetic resonance at this wavevector in the superconducting state of fetese@xcite .\nmoreover , ordering at such wavevectors nearly nests the electron and hole pockets , and therefore it is expected to couple strongly to superconductivity , explaining why the resulting anisotropy of the vortex cores is so large .\n_ note added : _ after this work was submitted for publication , another manuscript@xcite that studied the experimental features observed in fese @xcite came to our attention . in this paper , the authors study the effect of orbital ordering on the vortex structure in a two band model , by solving the bogoliubov -

zero @xmath145 always dominates over the energy cost of order @xmath146 for a sufficiently large @xmath145 . in order to prevent this instability\n, we have to add a term of the form @xmath147 to the free energy , which is an allowed term from the underlying symmetry of the problem .\nwe now want to obtain some restrictions on @xmath148 .\n+ first of all , @xmath148 should be such that it prevents the instability .\nthis gives us a lower bound on the value of @xmath148 . at the same time\n, @xmath148 should be small enough so that it should not change the physics significantly .\nthis gives us an upper bound on the value of @xmath148 .\ntherefore , we obtain , @xmath149 the above expression is not valid when @xmath3 becomes critical , i.e. when @xmath150 . in this case , we have to compare @xmath3 with @xmath151 .\n+ however , when we minimized the free energy in section [ min ] , we did not have to include the above term with a finite @xmath148 as for a sufficiently small @xmath55 , the cutoff in @xmath145 arising from the discrete lattice prevented this instability from showing up .\nin general , when we derive the gl equations from the free energy , there is a surface term arising from the gradient terms in the energy which can be ignored in the limit of an infinite system size .\nhowever , for a finite sized system , the boundary term does play an important role .\nlet us consider only the contribution of the gradient term of the superconducting order parameter in the free energy , in the absence of any nematic order .\nthen we have , @xmath152 where @xmath153 contains the usual @xmath154 terms . on varying @xmath155 by @xmath156 in @xmath157\n, we obtain for a finite system ( up to other variations due to @xmath153 denoted by @xmath158 ) , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the area element , normal to the boundary .\nwhen we solve for @xmath22 in the interior of the region , only the first term contributes and the boundary term can be ignored . however , when we solve for @xmath22 on the boundary , only the surface term plays a role , since it can be thought of as appearing with an infinite weight of the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the radius of the disk on which we are minimizing the free energy and @xmath163 is the dirac - delta function .\ntherefore , in order to solve for @xmath22 , we have to solve for @xmath164 in the interior of the region subject to the boundary condition @xmath165 ( neumann boundary conditions ) .\n+ now in the presence of a constant nematic background ( @xmath166 ) , the gradient term in the free energy is , @xmath167,\\ ] ] where @xmath168 . as we did earlier , on carrying out the variation over @xmath169 this\namounts to solving for @xmath170 subject to the boundary condition , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 in polar coordinates , this condition can be written as , @xmath173=0.\\ ] ]    these boundary conditions mean , in particular , that the current perpendicular to the boundary is zero . in our numerical calculations ,\nwe have used a disk geometry ; therefore the boundaries are found to have a significant effect whenever we are considering a non - circularly symmetric solution , in particular in the regime where the nematic order is non - zero even far away from the core .\nwe circumvent this problem , however , by taking a sufficiently large system and considering the solution only close to the vortex core , where the boundary effects are small .\nin this appendix , we analyze the asymptotics of the field @xmath3 far away from the vortex core in the case @xmath48 , in which the nematic order is critical . in this case , and for @xmath174 , the landau - ginzburg equation for @xmath3 ( eq . [ scaledphi ] ) becomes @xmath175\\phi=0.\\label{eq : phi_critical}\\ ] ] this non - linear equation admits the solution @xmath176 @xcite .\nthis solution is valid , however , for specific initial conditions , e.g. , @xmath177 , @xmath178 .\nphysically , the initial conditions for eq .\n[ eq : phi_critical ] are determined by the details of the vortex profile at short distances , determined by eq .\n[ scaledphi ] .\nnevertheless , one can make some general statements about the asymptotic behavior of the solution . if , for some arbitrary @xmath108 such that @xmath179 ( far from the core ) , @xmath3 satisfies @xmath180 , then it is justified to neglect the @xmath138 term in eq .\n[ eq : phi_critical ]\n. then , the solution close to @xmath108 behaves as @xmath181 , where @xmath107 , @xmath134 are determined by the initial conditions .\nthis can only be valid , however , up to a point @xmath182 at which @xmath183 , i.e. , at distances which are much smaller than the length scale set by the initial condition of eq .\n[ eq : phi_critical ] . at longer distances\n, we expect a crossover to @xmath184 .    in fig .\n[ fig : phi_r ] , we present a numerical solution of eq .\n[ eq : phi_critical ] with boundary conditions @xmath185 and various values for @xmath186 . when @xmath177 , we get @xmath187 ( where the deviations are due to the boundary condition at @xmath188 ) . for smaller @xmath186\n, there is an intermediate region where @xmath3 does not follow a power law , eventually crossing over to @xmath79 at larger @xmath35 .\n@xmath37 is approximately logarithmic in the intermediate region , as shown in fig .\n[ fig : phi_r]b .\nphysically , we expect that @xmath189 ( since @xmath190 corresponds to the equilibrium value of @xmath3 in the absence of superconductivity ) .\ntherefore , there is an intermediate logarithmic region , which becomes parametrically large in the limit of small @xmath3 .\nm. yi , d. lu , j .- h chu , j. g. analytis , a. p. sorini , a. f. kemper , b. moritz , s .- k .\nmo , r. g. moore , m. hashimoto , w .- s .\nlee , z. hussain , t. p. devereaux , i. r. fisher , and z .- x .\nshen , pnas * 108 * , 6878 ( 2011 ) .\ncan - li song , yi - lin wang , peng cheng , ye - ping jiang , wei li , tong zhang , zhi li , ke he , lili wang , jin - feng jia , hsiang - hsuan hung , congjun wu , xucun ma , xi chen , and qi - kun xue , science * 332 * , 1410 ( 2011 ) .\nsimilarly to the magnetic field induced antiferromagnetic order seen in certain cuprate superconductors .\nsee , e.g. , b. lake , h.m .\nrennow , n.b .\nchristensen , g. aeppli , k. lefmann , d.f .\nmcmorrow , p. vorderwisch , p. smeibidl , n. mangkorntong , t. sasagawa , m. nohara , h. takagi , and t.e .\nmason , nature(london ) * 415 * , 299 ( 2002 ) .\ns. medvedev , t.m .\nmcqueen , i.a .\ntroyan , t. palasyuk , m.i .\neremets , r.j .\ncava , s. naghavi , f. casper , v. ksenofontov , g. wortmann and c. felser , nat . mater .\n* 8 * , 630 ( 2009 ) .\ny. qiu , w. bao , y. zhao , c. broholm , v. stanev , z. tesanovic , y. c. gasparovic , s. chang , j. hu , bin qian , minghu fang , and zhiqiang mao , phys .\nlett . * 103 * , 067008 ( 2009 ) ; h. a. mook , m.d .\nlumsden , a.d .\nchristianson , brian c. sales , rongying jin , michael a. mcguire , athena sefat , d. mandrus , s.e .\nnagler , t. egami and c. de la cruz , arxiv:0904.2178 ( unpublished ) .",
