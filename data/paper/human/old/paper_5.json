    "article": "formation and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules @xcite have recently been achieved based on ultracold atoms with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances @xcite . in these experiments ,\nfeshbach coupling is induced by tuning a foreign molecular state near the scattering continuum , which allows for an efficient transfer of colliding atoms into molecules .\nthis method works for virtually all alkali atoms , and can create ultracold molecules from various sources including bose condensates @xcite , degenerate fermi gases @xcite , or normal thermal gases @xcite .\nfeshbach molecules have special and unique properties .\nthey typically populate only one weakly - bound quantum state , and the bound state can strongly couple to the scattering continuum via feshbach resonance .\nwe may ask the following question : should feshbach molecules rather be considered as molecules in a specific rovibrational state or as pairs of scattering atoms near the continuum ?\nthis distinction is particularly crucial in the studies of the bec to bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer state ) crossover in degenerate fermi gases , which call for a clarification of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecules @xcite .\nmolecular states near feshbach resonances have been recently investigated based on sophisticated and complete two - body or many - body theory @xcite and multi - channel scattering calculations @xcite .\nall works suggest that the feshbach molecule is generally a coherent mixture of the foreign molecule in the closed channel and long - range atom pair in the open scattering channel . near resonances with large resonance widths ,\nthe molecules can be well approximated as pairs in the open channel . for narrow resonances , as suggested by numerical calculation @xcite , the closed channel dominates and a short - range molecule picture is appropriate .    in this paper\n, we use a simple two - channel model to describe two interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance ( sec .\nii ) . to account for the finite interaction range of real atoms ,\nwe introduce a spherical box potential , which allows us to analytically calculate the molecular bound state in different regimes and their threshold behavior ( sec .\niii and sec .\niv ) . finally , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in recent fermi gas experiments and to characterize the associated feshbach resonances ( sec .\nwe model the interaction of two identical , ultracold atoms with mass @xmath0 based on an open channel @xmath1 that supports the scattering continuum and a closed channel @xmath2 that supports the foreign bound state .\nthe wave function of the atoms is generally expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the amplitudes in the open and closed channels , respectively , and @xmath6 is the inter - atomic separation .\nwe assume the interaction @xmath7 is described by a spherical box potential with an interaction range of @xmath8 , see fig .\n( 1 ) . for @xmath9 ,\nthe potential energy of the open channel is 0 and the closed channel @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , the open ( closed ) channel\nhas an attractive potential of @xmath12 @xmath13 , and a coupling term @xmath14 between the channels .\nthe wave function satisfies the schrdinger equation :    @xmath15    .\na bound state with energy @xmath16 relative to the scattering continuum is supported by the closed channel.,width=211 ]    the solution of the above equation for zero scattering energy @xmath17 can be expressed as :    @xmath18    where the scattering length @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants , @xmath21 are the \neigen wave numbers \" for @xmath11 associated with the eigen states    @xmath22 .\nbased on the boundary conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we get    @xmath25    the latter equation shows how in general , each channel contributes to the scattering length .    in cold atom systems ,\nfeshbach resonances are , in most cases , induced by hyperfine interactions or spin - spin interactions .\nboth interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than the relevant short range exchange potential .\nit is an excellent approximation to assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 .\nhence , we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in this limit ,\nthe closed channel contribution is significant only when the foreign state is close to the continuum , in which case the last term in eq .\n( 7 ) diverges .\ngiven the energy of the closed channel state as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the boundary condition @xmath33 allows us to expand the last term in eq .\n( 7 ) as @xmath34 . here\n@xmath35 characterizes the feshbach coupling strength . to the same order of expansion , the middle term in eq .\n( 7 ) is a constant across the resonance and can be identified as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the background scattering length .\nequation ( 7 ) reduces to    @xmath38\nexperimentally , the relative energy between the continuum and the bare state can be adjusted linearly by a magnetic field @xmath39-induced zeeman shift @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the magnetic moment of the open(closed ) channel .\nreplacing @xmath16 by @xmath43 , we can rewrite eq .\n( 8) in terms of the magnetic field as    @xmath44    where the resonance width @xmath45 and the resonance position @xmath46 are given by    @xmath47    several interesting features are shown here .\nfirst of all , we find the resonance width is proportional to both the feshbach coupling @xmath48 and the background scattering properties @xmath49 .\nthe latter dependence is due to the fact that the scattering amplitude at short range is proportional to the scattering length .\na larger short range scattering amplitude leads to a stronger coupling to the closed channel .\nsecondly and importantly , the resonance position is offset by exactly @xmath45 relative to the crossing of the bare state and the continuum , @xmath50 , see eq .  ( 11 ) . for a positive scattering length @xmath51 ,\nthis shift is negative @xmath52 .\nthis feature leads to the  renormalization \" of the feshbach resonance location discussed in ref .\n@xcite .    to understand the origin of the resonance shift\n, we should return to eq .\nthe divergence of the scattering length occurs when the open channel contribution ( middle term ) is exactly canceled by the closed channel one ( last term ) . for systems with large background scattering lengths @xmath53 and strong feshbach couplings @xmath48 , this cancelation can occur even when the bare state is far away from the continuum .\na large resonance shift then results .\nnow we turn to the binding energy of the molecules . assuming a bound eigen state @xmath54 exists near the continuum at @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the binding energy , we can determine @xmath57 by following essentially the same calculation as eq .\n( 1)-(7 ) .\nthe equivalence of eq .\n( 7 ) gives    @xmath58    where @xmath59 .\nassuming @xmath28 and the bound states in both channels are close to the continuum , namely , @xmath53 and @xmath60 , we can expand the two terms on the right side of eq .\n( 12 ) to leading order as @xmath36 and @xmath61 , respectively .\nequation  ( 12 ) then reduces to    @xmath62    this result shows the evolution of the eigen state near the resonance .\nsimilar result is obtained in ref .\n@xcite based on a contact potential .\nwe can immediately see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @xmath63 , the solutions of eq .\n( 13 ) are @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for @xmath51 ) , which exactly correspond to the bare bound states in the closed channel and the open channel ( for @xmath51 ) , respectively .    in the presence of the feshbach coupling @xmath66 , eq .\n( 13 ) suggests an  avoided level crossing \"- like energy structure , see fig .\n( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance position shifts .\nthe level crossing , however , is not hyperbolic as it is in a two - level system . in particular , at small binding energies , the bound state energy approaches the continuum quadratically , see fig .\n( 2 ) inset . far below the continuum ,\nthe bound state approaches the bare state in the closed channel .    , solid lines ) .\nwe assume ( a ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 and ( b ) @xmath69 and @xmath68 , where @xmath70 can be any relevant length scale .\narrows mark the offset resonance positions .\ninsets show the threshold behavior of the bound state.,width=268 ]    to better quantify the role of the open and closed channel , we can write the wave function of the eigen state as    @xmath71    and , with our approximations , @xmath72 satisfies    @xmath73    and the mixing angle @xmath74 is defined below .\nwe show in eq .\n( 15 ) that the eigen state generally occupies both the closed channel and open channel .\nwe can introduce a mixing amplitude @xmath75 as the amplitude in the closed channel    @xmath76    the mixing fraction @xmath77 can be evaluated by a direct integration of the closed channel wave function . alternatively , noticing that the mixing also leads to a dependence of the eigen state on the bare state , we can also derive @xmath77 from the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath16 , or from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule @xmath78 .\nall methods lead to the same result    @xmath79\ndespite the seemingly complex equations shown in previous sections , the feshbach molecules are simple and universal near the scattering continuum .\nexpanding eq .\n( 13 ) with small @xmath57 and using eq .\n( 9)-(11 ) , we find the binding energy of the feshbach molecules has a simple dependence on the scattering length and increases quadratically in magnetic field near the resonance , namely ,\n@xmath80    where @xmath81 .    equation ( 20 ) shows identical dependence on scattering length and interaction range as of single channel molecules in the threshold regime @xcite .\nfurthermore , taking the limit @xmath82 in eq .\n( 14 ) and ( 19 ) , we find the molecular wave function here is purely in the open channel .\nits spatial extent is determined by quantum uncertainty , @xmath83 , and can be much larger than the interaction range @xmath84 . in this limit ,\nthe feshbach molecules are identical to long - range atom pairs in a single open channel .    by expanding eq .\n( 19 ) at small @xmath85 and using eq .\n( 13 ) , we find the closed channel fraction can be expressed as @xmath86    where @xmath87 .    from eq .\n( 22 ) , we see that @xmath88 provides the leading order estimation of the closed channel admixture . when @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( this condition applies when @xmath91 ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel .\nas expected , the threshold regime is wider for resonances with larger @xmath48 and @xmath92 .\nwe can further determine the \nopen channel - dominated \" regime by setting @xmath93 in eq .\n( 19 ) . for resonances with small @xmath94\n, this condition corresponds to @xmath95 , which , in terms of magnetic field , maps to only a small fraction of @xmath96 near the resonance @xmath46 . for resonances with large @xmath97 , the open channel dominates when @xmath98 , which covers the full resonance width when @xmath99 , and covers the entire upper branch of the bound state when @xmath100 .\nbased on the range of the single channel regime , we suggest the broad(narrow ) resonances be defined as those with @xmath97 ( @xmath101 ) . within the width of the feshbach resonance , the molecules associated with a broad ( narrow ) resonance are better described as long range pairs in the open channel ( short range molecules in the closed channel ) .\nwe note that this definition is purely based on two - body physics .\n.parameters of the @xmath102li and @xmath103k feshbach resonances .\ninteraction range @xmath8 is derived from ref .\n@xcite , see text .\nfeshbach coupling @xmath48 is derived from eq .\n@xmath104 is bohr radius and @xmath105 is bohr magneton .
