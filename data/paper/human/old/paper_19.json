    "abstract": " a configuration space method is developed for binding energy calculations of the lowest energy exciton complexes ( trion , biexciton ) in spatially confined quasi-1d semiconductor nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes . \n quite generally , trions are shown to have greater binding energy in strongly confined structures with small reduced electron - hole masses . \n biexcitons have greater binding energy in less confined structures with large reduced electron - hole masses . \n this results in a universal crossover behavior , whereby trions become less stable than biexcitons as the transverse size of the quasi-1d nanostructure increases . \n the method is also capable of evaluating binding energies for electron - hole complexes in quasi-2d semiconductors such as coupled quantum wells and bilayer van der walls bound heterostructures with advanced optoelectronic properties .

    "article": "optical properties of low - dimensional semiconductor nanostructures originate from excitons ( coulomb - bound electron - hole pairs ) and exciton complexes such as biexcitons ( coupled states of two excitons ) and trions ( charged excitons ) .\nthese have pronounced binding energies in nanostructures due to the quantum confinement effect.@xcite the advantage of optoelectronic device applications with low - dimensional semiconductor nanostructures lies in the ability to tune their properties in a controllable way .\noptical properties of semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( cns ) , in particular , are largely determined by excitons,@xcite and can be tuned by electrostatic doping,@xcite or by means of the quantum confined stark effect.@xcite carbon nanotubes are graphene sheets rolled - up into cylinders of one to a few nanometers in diameter and up to hundreds of microns in length , which can be both metals and semiconductors depending on their diameters and chirality.@xcite over the past decade , optical nanomaterials research has uncovered intriguing optical attributes of their physical properties , lending themselves to a variety of new optoelectronic device applications.@xcite    formation of biexcitons and trions , though not detectable in bulk materials at room temperature , play a significant role in quantum confined systems of reduced dimensionality such as quantum wells,@xcite nanowires,@xcite nanotubes,@xcite and quantum dots.@xcite biexciton and trion excitations open up routes for controllable nonlinear optics and spinoptronics applications , respectively .\nthe trion , in particular , has both net charge and spin , and therefore can be controlled by electrical gates while being used for optical spin manipulation , or to investigate correlated carrier dynamics in low - dimensional materials .    for conventional semiconductor quantum wells , wires , and dots ,\nthe binding energies of negatively or positively charged trions are known to be typically lower than those of biexcitons in the same nanostructure , although the specific trion to biexciton binding energy ratios are strongly sample fabrication dependent.@xcite first experimental evidence for the trion formation in carbon nanotubes was reported by matsunaga et al.@xcite and by santos et al.@xcite on @xmath0-doped ( 7,5 ) and undoped ( 6,5 ) cns , respectively .\ntheoretically , rnnow et al.@xcite have predicted that the lowest energy trion states in all semiconducting cns with diameters of the order of or less than 1  nm should be stable at room temperature .\nthey have later developed the fractional dimension approach to simulate binding energies of trions and biexcitons in quasi-1d/2d semiconductors , including nanotubes as a particular case.@xcite binding energies of @xmath1  mev and @xmath2  mev are reported for the lowest energy trions@xcite and biexcitons,@xcite respectively , in the ( 7,5 ) nanotube .\nhowever , the recent nonlinear optics experiments were able to resolve both trions and biexcitons in the same cn sample,@xcite to report on the opposite tendency where the binding energy of the trion _ exceeds _ that of the biexciton rather significantly in small diameter ( @xmath3  nm ) cns .\nfigure  [ fig0 ] shows typical experimental data for conventional low - dimension semiconductors ( left panel ) and small diameter semicondicting cns ( right panel ) . in the left panel , the biexciton resonance is seen to appear at lower photon energy than the trion one , in contrast with the right panel where the biexciton resonance manifests itself at greater photon energy than the trion resonance does .\nthis clearly indicates greater trion binding energies than those of biexcitons in small diameter semiconducting cns as opposed to conventional low - dimension semiconductors .\n= 17.5 cm    more specifically , colombier et al.@xcite reported on the observation of the binding energies @xmath4  mev and @xmath5  mev for the trion and biexciton , respectively , in the ( 9,7 ) cn .\nyuma et al.@xcite reported even greater binding energies of @xmath6  mev for the trion versus @xmath7  mev for the biexciton in the smaller diameter ( 6,5 ) cn .\n( their spectra are reproduced in fig .\n[ fig0 ] , right panel . ) in both cases , the trion - to - biexciton binding energy ratio is greater than unity , decreasing as the cn diameter increases [ 1.46 for the 0.75  nm diameter ( 6,5 ) cn versus 1.42 for the 1.09  nm diameter ( 9,7 ) cn ] .\ntrion binding energies greater than those of biexcitons are theoretically reported by watanabe and asano,@xcite due to the energy band nonparabolicity and the coulomb screening effect that reduces the biexciton binding energy more than that of the trion .\nwatanabe and asano have extended the first order ( @xmath8)-perturbation series expansion model originally developed by ando for excitons ( see ref.@xcite for review ) to the case of electron - hole complexes such as trions and biexcitons .\nfigure  [ fig00 ] compares the differences between the trion and biexciton binding energies delivered by `` phenomenological '' and `` unscreened '' models termed as such to refer to the cases where the energy band nonparabolicity , electron - hole complex form - factors , self - energies and the screening effect are all neglected , and where all of them but screening are taken into account , respectively , with the difference given by the `` screened '' model .\nthe latter is the watanabe  asano model which includes _ all _ of the factors mentioned within the first order ( @xmath8)-perturbation theory .\none can see that the `` screened '' model does predict greater trion binding energies than those of biexcitons as opposed to the phenomenological and unscreened models .\nhowever , the most the trion binding energy can exceed that of the biexciton within this model is @xmath9 equal to @xmath10 and @xmath11  mev for the ( 6,5 ) and ( 9,7 ) cns , respectively , which is obviously not enough to explain the experimental observations .\n= 10.0 cm    this article reviews the capabilities of the configuration space ( landau - herring ) method for the binding energy calculations of the lowest energy exciton complexes in quasi-1d/2d semiconductors .\nthe approach was originally pioneered by landau,@xcite gorkov and pitaevski,@xcite holstein and herring@xcite in the studies of molecular binding and magnetism .\nthe method was recently shown to be especially advantageous in the case of quasi-1d semiconductors,@xcite allowing for easily tractable , complete analytical solutions to reveal universal asymptotic relations between the binding energy of the exciton complex of interest and the binding energy of the exciton in the same nanostructure .\nthe landau - herring method of the complex bound state binding energy calculation is different from commonly used quantum mechanical approaches reviewed above .\nthese either use advanced simulation techniques to solve the coordinate - space schrdinger equation numerically,@xcite or convert it into the reciprocal ( momentum ) space to follow up with the ( @xmath8)-perturbation series expansion calculations.@xcite obviously , this latter one , in particular , requires for perturbations to be small .\nif they are not , then the method brings up an underestimated binding energy value , especially for molecular complexes such as biexciton and trion where the kinematics of complex formation depends largely on the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions of the constituents .\nthis is likely the cause for watanabe \nasano theory of excitonic complexes@xcite to significantly underestimate the measurements by colombier et al.@xcite and yuma et al.@xcite on semiconducting cns .\n= 11.5 cm    the landau - herring configuration space approach does not have this shortcoming .\nit works in the _ configuration space _ of the _ two _ relative electron - hole motion coordinates of the _ two _ non - interacting quasi-1d excitons that are modeled by the effective one - dimensional cusp - type coulomb potential as proposed by ogawa and takagahara for 1d semiconductors.@xcite since the configuration space is different from the ordinary coordinate ( or its reciprocal momentum ) space , the approach does not belong to any of the models summarized in fig .\n[ fig00 ] . in this approach , the biexciton or trion bound state forms due to the exchange under - barrier tunneling between the equivalent configurations of the electron - hole system in the configuration space .\nthe strength of the binding is controlled by the exchange tunneling rate .\nthe corresponding binding energy is given by the tunnel exchange integral determined through an appropriate variational procedure .\nas any variational approach , the method gives an upper bound for the _ ground _ state binding energy of the exciton complex of interest .\nas an example , fig .  [ fig000 ] compares the biexciton binding energies calculated within several different models , including those coordinate - space formulated that are referred to as phenomenological in fig .\n[ fig00 ] , as well as the configuration space model .\nit is quite remarkable that with obvious overall correspondence to the other methods as seen in fig .\n[ fig000 ] , the landau - herring configuration space approach is the only to have been able consistently explain the experimental observations discussed above and shown in fig .\n[ fig0 ] , both for conventional low - dimension semiconductors and for semiconducting cns .\nwhether the trion or biexciton is more stable ( has greater binding energy ) in a particular quasi-1d system turns out to depend on the reduced electron - hole mass and on the characteristic transverse size of the system.@xcite trions are generally more stable than biexcitons in strongly confined quasi-1d structures with small reduced electron - hole masses , while biexcitons are more stable than trions in less confined quasi-1d structures with large reduced electron - hole masses .\nas such , a crossover behavior is predicted,@xcite whereby trions get less stable than biexcitons as the transverse size of the quasi-1d nanostructure increases  quite a general effect which could likely be observed through comparative measurements on semiconducting cns of increasing diameter .\nthe method captures the essential kinematics of exciton complex formation , thus helping understand in simple terms the general physical principles that underlie experimental observations on biexcitons and trions in a variety of quasi-1d semiconductor nanostructures . for semiconducting cns with diameters @xmath12  nm\n, the model predicts the trion binding energy greater than that of the biexciton by a factor @xmath13 that decreases with the cn diameter increase , in reasonable agreement with the measurements by colombier et al.@xcite and yuma et al.@xcite    the article is structured as follows .\nsection 2 formulates the general hamiltonian for the biexciton complex of two electrons and two holes in quasi-1d semiconductor .\ncarbon nanotubes of varying diameter are used as a model example for definiteness . the theory and conclusions\nare valid for any quasi-1d semiconductor system in general .\nthe exchange integral and the binding energy of the biexciton complex are derived and analyzed .\nsection 3 further develops the theory to include the trion case .\nin section 4 , the trion binding energy derived is compared to the biexciton binding energy for semiconducting quasi-1d nanostructures of varying transverse size and reduced exciton effective mass .\nsection 5 generalizes the method to include trion and biexciton complexes formed by indirect excitons in layered quasi-2d semiconductor structures such as coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) and bilayer self - assembled transition metal dichalchogenide heterostructures .\nsection 6 summarizes and concludes the article .\nthe problem is initially formulated for two interacting ground - state 1d excitons in a semiconducting cn .\nthe cn is taken as a model for definiteness .\nthe theory and conclusions are valid for any quasi-1d semiconductor system in general .\nthe excitons are modeled by effective one - dimensional cusp - type coulomb potentials , shown in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) , as proposed by ogawa and takagahara for 1d semiconductors.@xcite the intra - exciton motion can be legitimately treated as being much faster than the inter - exciton center - of - mass relative motion since the exciton itself is normally more stable than any of its compound complexes .\ntherefore , the adiabatic approximation can be employed to simplify the formulation of the problem . with this in mind , using the cylindrical coordinate system [ _ z_-axis along the cn as in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ] and separating out circumferential and longitudinal degrees of freedom for each of the excitons by transforming their longitudinal motion into their respective center - of - mass coordinates,@xcite one arrives at the hamiltonian of the form@xcite @xmath14 here , @xmath15 are the relative electron - hole motion coordinates of the two 1d excitons separated by the center -

hole coulomb potential .\n= 11.0 cm    the first two lines in eq .\n( [ biexcham ] ) represent two non - interacting 1d excitons .\ntheir individual potentials are symmetrized to account for the presence of the neighbor a distance  @xmath27 away , as seen from the @xmath28- and @xmath29-coordinate systems treated independently [ fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ] .\nthe last two lines are the inter - exciton exchange coulomb interactions  electron - hole ( line next to last ) and hole - hole + electron - electron ( last line ) , respectively .\nthe binding energy @xmath30 of the biexciton is given by the difference @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian  ( [ biexcham ] ) and @xmath33 is the single - exciton binding energy with @xmath34 being the lowest - bound - state quantum number of the 1d exciton.@xcite negative\n@xmath30 indicates that the biexciton is stable with respect to the dissociation into two isolated excitons . the strong transverse confinement in reduced dimensionality semiconductors is known to result in the mass reversal effect,@xcite whereby the bulk heavy hole state , that forming the _ lowest _ excitation energy exciton , acquires a longitudinal mass comparable to the bulk _ light _ hole mass ( @xmath35 ) .\ntherefore , @xmath36 in our case of interest here , which is also true for graphitic systems such as cns , in particular,@xcite and so @xmath37 is assumed in eq .\n( [ biexcham ] ) in what follows with no substantial loss of generality .\nthe hamiltonian ( [ biexcham ] ) is effectively two dimensional in the configuration space of the two _ independent _ relative motion coordinates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .\nfigure  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) , bottom , shows schematically the potential energy surface of the two closely spaced non - interacting 1d excitons [ second line of eq .\n( [ biexcham ] ) ] in the @xmath38 space .\nthe surface has four symmetrical minima representing isolated two - exciton states shown in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) , top .\nthese minima are separated by the potential barriers responsible for the tunnel exchange coupling between the two - exciton states in the configuration space .\nthe coordinate transformation @xmath39 places the origin of the new coordinate system into the intersection of the two tunnel channels between the respective potential minima [ fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ] , whereby the exchange splitting formula of refs.@xcite takes the form @xmath40 here @xmath41 are the ground - state and excited - state energies , eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  ( [ biexcham ] ) , of the two coupled excitons as functions of their center - of - mass - to - center - of - mass separation , and @xmath42 is the tunnel exchange coupling integral responsible for the bound state formation of two excitons . for biexciton , this takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the solution to the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian  ( [ biexcham ] ) transformed to the @xmath45 coordinates .\nthe factor @xmath46 comes from the fact that there are two equivalent tunnel channels in the biexciton problem , mixing three equivalent indistinguishable two - exciton states in the configuration space  one state is given by the two minima on the @xmath47-axis and two more are represented by each of the minima on the @xmath48-axis [ cf .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) and fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( b ) ] .\nthe function @xmath44 in eq .\n( [ jxx ] ) is sought in the form @xmath49\\ , , \\label{psixxxy}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 \\label{psi0xy}\\ ] ] is the product of two single - exciton wave functions ( ground state ) representing the isolated two - exciton state centered at the minimum @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) of the configuration space potential [ fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ] .\nthis is the approximate solution to the shrdinger equation with the hamiltonin given by the first two lines in eq .\n( [ biexcham ] ) , where the cut - off parameter @xmath17 is neglected.@xcite this approximation greatly simplifies problem solving , while still remaining adequate as only the long - distance tail of @xmath54 is important for the tunnel exchange coupling .\nthe function @xmath55 , on the other hand , is a slowly varying function to account for the major deviation of @xmath56 from @xmath54 in its `` tail area '' due to the tunnel exchange coupling to another equivalent isolated two - exciton state centered at @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 , @xmath53 ) .    substituting eq .\n( [ psixxxy ] ) into the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ biexcham ] ) pre - transformed to the @xmath45 coordinates , one obtains in the region of interest ( @xmath17 dropped for the reason above ) @xmath60 up to negligible terms of the order of the inter - exciton  van der waals energy and up to the second order derivatives of  @xmath61 .\nthis equation is to be solved with the boundary condition @xmath62 originating from the natural requirement @xmath63 , to result in @xmath64 after plugging this into eq .\n( [ psixxxy ] ) one can calculate the tunnel exchange coupling integral  ( [ jxx ] ) . retaining only the leading term of the integral series expansion in powers of @xmath34 subject to @xmath65 , one obtains @xmath66    the ground state energy @xmath67 of the two coupled 1d excitons in eq .\n( [ egu ] ) is now seen to go through the negative minimum ( biexcitonic state ) as @xmath27 increases .\nthe minimum occurs at @xmath68 , whereby the biexciton binding energy takes the form @xmath69 in atomic units . expressing @xmath34 in terms of @xmath70 , one obtains in absolute units the equation as follows @xmath71    = 11.0 cm\nthe trion binding energy can be found in the same way using a modification of the hamiltonian ( [ biexcham ] ) , in which two same - sign particles share the third particle of an opposite sign to form the two equivalent 1d excitons as fig .\n[ fig2 ] shows for the negative trion complex consisting of the hole shared by the two electrons .\nthe hamiltonian modified to reflect this fact has the first two lines exactly the same as in eq .\n( [ biexcham ] ) , no line next to last , and one of the two terms in the last line  either the first or the second one for the positive ( with @xmath72 ) and negative ( with @xmath73 ) trion , respectively . obviously , due to the additional mass factor @xmath74 ( typically less than one for bulk semiconductors ) in the hole - hole interaction term in the last line\n, the positive trion might be expected to have a greater binding energy in this model , in agreement with the results reported earlier.@xcite however , as was already mentioned in sec .\n[ sec2 ] , the mass reversal effect in _ strongly _ confined reduced dimensionality semiconductors is to result in @xmath37 in the trion hamiltonian .\nthe positive - negative trion binding energy difference disappears then .\nthe negative trion case illustrated in fig .\n[ fig2 ] , is addressed below .\njust like in the case of the biexciton , the treatment of the trion problem starts with the coordinate transformation  ( [ transformation ] ) to bring the trion hamiltonian from the original ( configuration space ) coordinate system @xmath38 into the new coordinate system @xmath45 with the origin positioned as shown in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) .\nthe tunnel exchange splitting integral in eq .\n( [ egu ] ) now takes the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ground - state wave function of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ biexcham ] ) modified to the negative trion case , as discussed above , and then transformed to the @xmath45 coordinates .\nthe tunnel exchange current integral @xmath77 is due to the electron position exchange relative to the hole ( see fig .\n[ fig2 ] ) .\nthis corresponds to the tunneling of the entire three particle system between the two equivalent indistinguishable configurations of the two excitons sharing the same hole in the configuration space @xmath38 , given by the pair of minima at @xmath51 and @xmath78 in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) .\nsuch a tunnel exchange interaction is responsible for the coupling of the three particle system to form a stable trion state .    like in the case of the biexciton ,\none seeks the function @xmath79 in the form @xmath80\\ , , \\label{psixy}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 given by eq .\n( [ psi0xy ] ) , where @xmath82 is assumed to be a _\nslowly _ varying function to take into account the deviation of @xmath83 from @xmath54 in the `` tail area '' of @xmath54 due to the tunnel exchange coupling to another equivalent isolated two - exciton state centered at @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 , @xmath53 ) .\nsubstituting eq .\n( [ psixy ] ) into the schrdinger equation with the negative trion hamiltonian pre - transformed to the @xmath45 coordinates , one obtains in the region of interest @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , cut - off @xmath17 dropped ) up to terms of the order of the second derivatives of  @xmath86 .\nthis is to be solved with the boundary condition @xmath87 coming from the requirement @xmath88 , to result in @xmath89    after plugging eqs .\n( [ sxy ] ) and ( [ psixy ] ) into eq .\n( [ jxast ] ) , and retaining only the leading term of the integral series expansion in powers of @xmath34 subject to @xmath65 , one obtains @xmath90 inserting this into the right - hand side of eq .\n( [ egu ] ) , one sees that the ground state energy @xmath32 of the three particle system goes through the negative minimum ( the trion state ) as @xmath27 increases .\nthe minimum occurs at @xmath68 , whereby the trion binding energy in atomic units takes the form @xmath91 in absolute units , expressing @xmath34 in terms of @xmath70 , one obtains @xmath92    = 12.0 cm\nfrom eqs .  ( [ exx ] ) and ( [ exstar ] ) ,\none has the trion - to - biexciton binding energy ratio as follows @xmath94 if one now assumes @xmath95 ( @xmath96 is the dimensionless cn radius , or transverse confinement size for quasi-1d nanostructure in general ) as was demonstrated earlier by variational calculations@xcite to be consistent with many quasi-1d models,@xcite then one obtains the @xmath96-dependences of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .\nthe trion and biexciton binding energies both decrease with increasing @xmath96  in such a way that their ratio remains greater than unity for small enough @xmath96  in full agreement with the experiments by colombier et al.@xcite and yuma et al.@xcite however , since the factor @xmath100 in eq .\n( [ exstarexx ] ) is less than one , the ratio can also be less than unity for @xmath96 large enough ( but not too large , so that our configuration space method still works ) .    as @xmath96 goes down , on the other hand , the biexciton - to - exciton binding energy ratio @xmath101 in eq .\n( [ exx ] ) slowly grows , approaching the pure 1d limit @xmath102 .\nsimilar tendency can also be traced in the monte - carlo simulation data of ref.@xcite the equilibrium inter - exciton center - of - mass distance in the biexciton complex goes down with decreasing @xmath96 as well , @xmath103 ( atomic units ) .\nthis supports experimental evidence for enhanced exciton - exciton annihilation in small diameter cns.@xcite the trion - to - exciton binding energy ratio @xmath104 of eq .\n( [ exstar ] ) increases with decreasing @xmath96 faster than @xmath101 ( fig .\n[ fig3 ] ) , to yield @xmath105 as the pure 1d limit for the trion - to - biexciton binding energy ratio .\n= 11.5 cm    when @xmath99 is known , one can use eq .\n( [ exstarexx ] ) to estimate the effective bohr radii @xmath106 for the excitons in the cns of known radii .\nfor example , substituting @xmath107 for the 0.75  nm diameter ( 6,5 ) cn and @xmath108 for the 1.09  nm diameter ( 9,7 ) cn , as reported by yuma et al.@xcite and colombier et al.,@xcite respectively , into the left hand side of the transcendental equation  ( [ exstarexx ] ) and solving it for @xmath106 , one obtains the effective exciton bohr radius @xmath109  nm and @xmath110  nm for the ( 6,5 ) cn and ( 9,7 ) cn , respectively .\nthis agrees reasonably with previous estimates.@xcite    in general , the binding energies in eqs .\n( [ exstar ] ) and ( [ exx ] ) are functions of the cn radius ( transverse confinement size for a quasi-1d semiconductor nanowire ) , @xmath111 and  @xmath26 .\nfigures  [ fig4 ]  ( a ) and  [ fig4 ]  ( b ) show their 3d plots at fixed @xmath112 and at fixed @xmath113 , respectively , as functions of two remaining variables .\nthe reduced effective mass @xmath111 chosen is typical of large radius excitons in small - diameter cns.@xcite the unit dielectric constant @xmath26 assumes the cn placed in air and the fact that there is no screening in quasi-1d semiconductor systems both at short and at large electron - hole separations.@xcite this latter assumption of the unit background dielectric constant remains legitimate for _ small _ diameter ( @xmath3  nm ) semiconducting cns in dielectric screening environment , too ,  for the lowest excitation energy exciton in its ground state of interest here ( not for its excited states though ) , in which case the environment screening effect is shown by ando to be negligible,@xcite diminishing quickly with the increase of the effective distance between the cn and dielectric medium relative to the cn diameter .\nfigure  [ fig4 ]  ( a ) can be used to evaluate the relative stability of the trion and biexciton complexes in quasi-1d semiconductors .\none sees that whether the trion or the biexciton is more stable ( has the greater binding energy ) in a particular quasi-1d system depends on @xmath111 and on the characteristic transverse size of the nanostructure . in strongly confined quasi-1d systems with relatively small @xmath111 , such as small - diameter cns , the trion is generally more stable than the biexciton . in less confined quasi-1d structures with greater @xmath111 typical of semiconductors,@xcite\nthe biexciton is more stable than the trion .\nthis is a generic peculiarity in the sense that it comes from the tunnel exchange in the quasi-1d electron - hole system in the configuration space .\ngreater @xmath111 , while not affecting significantly the single charge tunnel exchange in the trion complex , makes the neutral biexciton complex generally more compact , facilitating the mixed charge tunnel exchange in it and thus increasing the stability of the complex . from fig .\n[ fig4 ]  ( b ) one sees that this generic feature is not affected by the variation of @xmath26 , although the increase of @xmath26 decreases the binding energies of both excitonic complexes  in agreement both with theoretical studies@xcite and with experimental observations of lower binding energies ( compared to those in cns ) of these complexes in conventional semiconductor nanowires.@xcite the latter are self - assembled nanostructures of one ( transversely confined ) semiconductor embedded in another ( bulk ) semiconductor with the characteristic transverse confinement size typically greater than that of small diameter cns , and so both inside and outside material dielectric properties matter there .\n= 12.0 cm    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the cross - section of fig .\n[ fig4 ]  ( a ) taken at @xmath114 to present the relative behavior of @xmath97 and @xmath98 in semiconducting cns of increasing radius . both @xmath97 and @xmath98 decrease , and\nso does their ratio , as the cn radius increases . from the graph , @xmath115 and @xmath116  mev , @xmath117 and @xmath118  mev , for the ( 6,5 ) and ( 9,7 ) cns , respectively .\nthis is to be compared with @xmath6 and @xmath7  mev for the ( 6,5 ) cn versus @xmath4 and @xmath5  mev for the ( 9,7 ) cn reported experimentally.@xcite one sees that , as opposed to perturbative theories,@xcite the present configuration space theory underestimates experimental data just slightly , most likely due to the standard variational treatment limitations .\nit does explain well the trends observed , and so the graph in fig .\n[ fig5 ] can be used as a guide for trion and biexciton binding energy estimates in small diameter ( @xmath3  nm ) nanotubes .\nrecently , there has been a considerable interest in studies of optical properties of coupled quantum wells ( cqws).@xcite the cqw semiconductor nanostructure ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) consists of two identical semiconductor quantum wells separated by a thin barrier layer of another semiconductor .\nthe tunneling of carriers through the barrier makes two wells electronically coupled to each other . as a result\n, an electron ( a hole ) can either reside in one of the wells , or its wave function can be distributed between both wells . a coulomb bound electron - hole pair residing in the same well forms a direct exciton [ fig .  [ fig6 ]  ( a ) ] .\nif the electron and hole of a pair are located in different wells , then an indirect exciton is formed [ fig .\n[ fig6 ]  ( b ) ] .\n= 12.0cm-0.5 cm    physical properties of cqws can be controlled by using external electro- and magnetostatic fields .\n( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and refs . therein . ) for example , applying the electrostatic field perpendicular to the layers increases the exciton radiative lifetime due to a reduction in the spatial overlap ( contact density ) between the electron and hole wave functions . as this takes place , the exciton binding energy reduces due to an increased electron - hole separation to make the exciton less stable against ionization , in contrast with the exciton magnetostatic stabilization effect under the same geometry.@xcite the tunneling effect is also enhanced as the electric field allows the carriers to leak out of the system , resulting in a considerable shortening of the photoluminescence decay time .\ncqws embedded into bragg - mirror microcavities show a special type of voltage - tuned exciton polaritons , which can be used for low - threshold power polariton lasing.@xcite new non - linear phenomena are also reported for these cqw systems both theoretically and experimentally , such as bose condensation@xcite and parametric oscillations@xcite of exciton polaritons . for laterally confined cqw structures , experimental evidence for controllable formation of multiexciton wigner - like molecular complexes of indirect excitons ( single exciton , biexciton , triexciton , etc . )\nwas reported recently.@xcite trion complexes formed both by direct and by indirect excitons , as sketched in figs .\n[ fig6 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , were observed in cqws as well.@xcite all these findings make cqws a much richer system capable of new developments in fundamental quantum physics and nanotechnology as compared to single quantum wells.@xcite they open up new routes for non - linear coherent optical control and spinoptronics applications with quasi-2d semiconductor cqw nanostructures .\nvery recently , the problem of the trion complex formation in cqws was studied theoretically in great detail for trions composed of a _ direct _ exciton and an electron ( or a hole ) located in the neighboring quantum well@xcite [ as sketched in fig .\n[ fig6 ]  ( a ) ] .\nsignificant binding energies are predicted on the order of @xmath119  mev at interwell separations @xmath120  nm for the lowest energy positive and negative trion states , to allow one suggest a possibility for trion wigner crystallization .\nfigure  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) shows another possible trion complex that can also be realized in cqws . here\n, the trion is composed of an _ indirect _ exciton and an electron ( or a hole ) in such a manner as to keep two same - sign particles in the same quantum well with the opposite - sign particle being located in the neighboring well .\nthis can be viewed as the two equivalent configurations of the three - particle system in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) of the two _ independent _ in - plane projections of the relative electron - hole distances @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the two _ equivalent _ indirect excitons sharing the same electron , or the same hole as shown in fig .\n[ fig6 ]  ( b ) .\nsuch a three - particle system in the quasi-2d semiconductor cqw nanostructure is quite analogous to the quasi-1d trion presented in sec .  3 above [ cf .\n[ fig6 ]  ( b ) and fig .\n[ fig2 ] ] .\ntherefore , the landau - herring configuration space approach can be used here as well to evaluate the binding energy for this special case of the quasi-2d trion state .\nfollowing is a brief outline of how one could proceed with the configuration space method to obtain the ground state binding energy for the quasi-2d trion complex sketched in fig  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) .\na complete analysis of the problem will be presented elsewhere .\nthe method requires knowledge of the ground state characteristics of the indirect exciton ( abbreviated as `` @xmath125 '' in what follows ) .\nspecifically , one needs to know the quasi-2d ground state energy @xmath126 and corresponding _ in - plane _ relative electron - hole motion wave function @xmath127 for the indirect exciton in the cqw system with the interwell distance @xmath128 .\nthese can be found by solving the radial scrdinger equation that is obtained by decoupling radial relative electron - hole motion in the cylindrical coordinate system with the @xmath129-axis being perpendicular to the qw layers [ see fig  [ fig6 ]  ( b ) ] . such an equation was derived and analyzed previously by leavitt and little.@xcite the energy and the wave function of interest are as follows @xmath130 \\label{indirect}\\\\[-0.2 cm ] \\psi_{i\\!x}(\\rho , d)=n\\exp[-\\lambda(\\sqrt{\\rho^2+d^2}-d)]\\,,\\hskip0.5cm\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the exponential integral , @xmath132 , the normalization constant @xmath133 is determined from the condition @xmath134 and all quantities are measured in atomic units as defined in sec .  2 .\n= 12.0 cm    with eq .\n( [ indirect ] ) in place , one can work out strategies for tunneling current calculations in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) of the two _ independent _ in - plane projections of the relative electron - hole distances @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the two _ equivalent _ indirect excitons as shown in fig .\n[ fig6 ]  ( b ) . both tunneling current responsible for the trion complex formation and that responsible for the biexciton complex formation can be obtained in full analogy with how it was done above for the respective quasi-1d complexes .\nthe only formal difference now is the change in the phase integration volume from @xmath135 to @xmath136 . minimizing the tunneling current with respect to the center - of - mass - to - center - of - mass distance of the two equivalent indirect excitons results in the binding energy of a few - particle complex of interest .\nnote that the method applies to the complexes formed by _\nexcitons only as they allow equivalent configurations for a few - particle system to tunnel throughout in the configuration space ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , thereby forming a respective ( tunnel ) coupled few - particle complex .\nbinding energy calculations for indirect exciton complexes in semiconductor cqw nanostructures are important to understand the principles of the more complicated electron - hole structure formation such as that shown in fig .\nthis is a coupled charge - neutral spin - aligned wigner - like structure formed by two trions , one positively charged and another one negatively charged .\nthe entire structure is electrically neutral , and it has an interesting electron - hole spin alignment pattern .\nthis structure can also be viewed as a triexciton , a coupled state of three indirect singlet excitons .\none could also imagine a wigner - like crystal structure formed by unequal number of electrons and holes , as opposed to that in fig .\n[ fig7 ] , whereby the entire coupled structure could possess net charge and spin at the same time to allow precise electro- and magnetostatic control and manipulation by its optical and spin properties .\nsuch wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures in cqws might be of great interest for spinoptronics applications .\nall in all , indirect excitons , biexcitons and trions formed by indirect excitons are those building blocks that control the formation of more complicated wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures in cqws .\nthe configuration space method presented here allows one to study the binding energies for these building blocks as functions of cqw system parameters , and thus to understand how stable electron - hole wigner crystallization could possibly be in these quasi-2d nanostructures .\nthe method should also work well for biexciton and trion complexes in quasi-2d self - assembled transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures , where electrons and holes accumulated in the opposite neighboring monolayers are recently reported to form indirect excitons with new exciting properties such as increased recombination time@xcite and vanishing high - temperature viscosity.@xcite\npresented herein is a universal configuration space method for binding energy calculations of the lowest energy neutral ( biexciton ) and charged ( trion ) exciton complexes in spatially confined quasi-1d semiconductor nanostructures .\nthe method works in the effective two - dimensional configuration space of the two relative electron - hole motion coordinates of the two non - interacting quasi-1d excitons .\nthe biexciton or trion bound state forms due to under - barrier tunneling between equivalent configurations of the electron - hole system in the configuration space .\ntunneling rate controls the binding strength and can be turned into the binding energy by means of an appropriate variational procedure .\nquite generally , trions are shown to be more stable ( have greater binding energy ) than biexcitons in strongly confined quasi-1d structures with small reduced electron - hole masses .\nbiexcitons are more stable than trions in less confined structures with large reduced electron - hole masses . a universal crossover behavior is predicted whereby trions become less stable than biexcitons as the transverse size of the quasi-1d nanostructure increases .\nan outline is given of how the method can be used for electron - hole complexes of indirect excitons in quasi-2d semiconductor systems such as coupled quantum wells and van der waals bound transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures . here\n, indirect excitons , biexcitons , and trions formed by indirect excitons control the formation of more complicated wigner - like electron - hole crystal structures .\nthe configuration space method can help develop understanding of how stable wigner crystallization could be in these quasi-2d nanostructures .\nwigner - like electron - hole crystal structures are of great interest for future spinoptronics applications .\nthis work is supported by the us department of energy ( de - sc0007117 ) .\ndiscussions with david tomanek ( michigan state u. ) , roman kezerashvili ( ny@xmath137citytech ) , and masha vladimirova ( u. montpellier , france ) are acknowledged .\nthanks tony heinz ( stanford u. ) for pointing out ref.@xcite of relevance to this work .\n[ 99 ] h.haug and s.w.koch , _ quantum theory of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors _ , 5th edn .\n( world scientific , london , 2005 ) .\np.y.yu and m.cardona , _ fundamentals of semiconductors _ , 4th edn .\n( springer -
