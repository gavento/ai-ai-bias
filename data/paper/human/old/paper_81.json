    "article": "in the past several years , deep field surveys have made remarkable breakthroughs in studies on high redshift galaxies .\nthe most successful survey would be the hubble deep fields which are deep enough to study high-_z _ galaxies up to @xmath18 .\nmany efforts on spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations reveal hundreds of high-_z _ galaxies and their properties ( e.g.@xcite ) .\nhowever the surveyed areas of hdfs are as small as a few arcmin@xmath3 each , so they may be affected by field - to - field variations .\nsteidel and his collaborators have pioneered in statistical studies of high-_z _ galaxies based on ground - based wide survey data @xcite .\nthey isolate high-_z _ galaxies in a two - color plane using the uv continuum features , and galaxies selected in this way are called lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .\nthey studied the number density @xcite , the spatial distribution @xcite , nebular emission lines @xcite , and the stellar population @xcite .\nmost of their studies are based on @xmath19 lbg samples which were selected using @xmath20 colors . in this contribution , we extend the study to @xmath4 lbgs based on our @xmath2 data taken with a newly installed subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam:@xcite ) , which is a unique wide - field imager mounted on the 8 m subaru telescope . throughout this contribution , magnitudes are in the ab system , and all calculations assume a @xmath21-dominated spatially flat cosmology , @xmath22 .\ndeep and wide - field @xmath23-,@xmath24-,@xmath25- , and @xmath26-band imaging data of a central @xmath27 area in the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey field ( @xmath28,@xmath29[j2000 ] ) were taken with suprime - cam during the commissioning observing runs on 2000 november 24 - 27 .\nthe present work is based on the @xmath23,@xmath25 , and @xmath26 data .\nthe individual ccd data were reduced and combined using iraf and the mosaic - ccd data reduction software developed by us @xcite .\nthe final images cover a contiguous 618 arcmin@xmath3 area with a point - spread function fwhm of @xmath30 .\nthe net exposure times of the final images are 177 , 58 , and 45 minutes for @xmath23 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .\nthe limiting magnitudes are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for a @xmath34 detection in a @xmath35 diameter aperture .\nthe @xmath26-band frame is chosen to detect objects , and we limit the object catalog to @xmath36 , in order to provide a reasonable level of photometric completeness .\nour catalog contains 42,557 objects with @xmath37 in total . on the basis of expectations from gissel96 @xcite population synthesis models ,\nwe define the photometric selection criteria for galaxies at @xmath4 ( @xcite for model parameters ) as @xmath38 we estimate the redshift distribution , @xmath39 , of galaxies satisfying equation ( [ eq : lbgselection ] ) from the hdf - n objects for which magnitudes , colors , and photometric redshifts are given in @xcite .\nwe find that the criteria select @xmath40 galaxies .\nthere are a total of 1192 objects that meet the criteria .\nfigure [ fig : bri_diagram_disp ] shows the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 color diagram for model galaxies and gunn & stryker s stars @xcite ( _ left panel _ ) , and for @xmath43 detected objects in our data ( _ right panel _ ) .\nthe left panel demonstrates that @xmath4 galaxies are well isolated from interlopers , i.e. , low-_z _ galaxies and galactic stars .\nwe have estimated the contamination and completeness of our lbg sample by monte carlo simulations , generating artificial objects which mimic the hdf - n galaxies and distributing them on our original images .\nthe contamination is defined , for the detected simulated objects , as the ratio of low - redshift ( @xmath44 ) objects meeting equation ( [ eq : lbgselection ] ) to all the objects satisfying equation ( [ eq : lbgselection ] ) .\nthe completeness is defined as the ratio of @xmath45 simulated objects passing our detection threshold @xmath46 satisfying equation ( [ eq : lbgselection ] ) to all ( detected @xmath47 undetected ) @xmath45 simulated objects .\nwe find from the simulations that the completeness and the contamination are 45% and 17% , respectively .\nthe uv luminosity function ( lf ) of @xmath4 lbgs is derived from our 1192 objects with @xmath1 .\nwe calculate the surveyed effective volume which is the integrated volume from @xmath48 to @xmath49 by taking into account the completeness and contamination of the sample selection , and n(z ) (  [ sec : lbgselection ] ) .\nthe lf is shown in figure [ fig : lumifun](a ) , together with those at @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite .\nthe lf of our @xmath4 lbg sample is consistent with the one derived by @xcite .\nwe fit the schechter function to the lf , and find @xmath51@xmath52 , @xmath53 with a fixed slope @xmath54 .\nit is found from figure [ fig : lumifun](a ) , that all the lfs from z=0 to 4 seem to prefer a steep slope , @xmath55 .\nthe @xmath56s at @xmath573 and 4 are about 2 magnitude brighter than that at z=0 .\nthe number of bright ( @xmath58 ) galaxies are much larger at high redshifts than in the local universe , while that of faint galaxies are comparable .\nthis implies that a large population of uv - luminous galaxies exists only at high redshifts .\nthis population reflects the high cosmic starformation rates at high redshifts , which were derived by @xcite and @xcite .\nthere are two extreme explanations for this population .\none is that the star - formation rate of @xmath59 galaxies is intrinsically higher than that for @xmath50 galaxies , and the other is that the @xmath59 galaxies are very dust - poor ( or partially dust free ) and thus the @xmath56 values are apparently brighter than that for @xmath50 galaxies which suffer from non - neglibible dust extinction .\na detailed discussion will be given in @xcite .\nwe divide our whole lbg sample into two subsamples , _ blue _ and _ red _ , by the @xmath42 color .\nthe blue ( red ) sample is composed of objects bluer ( redder ) than the median color of the whole sample , @xmath60 .\nthe lfs of red and blue samples are calculated in the same manner as for the whole sample .\nfigure [ fig : lumifun](b ) shows the lfs of red and blue samples .\nthese lfs are not significantly different at the faint end ( @xmath61 ) , however , the lf of red sample seems to be higher than that of the blue sample at the bright end ( @xmath62 ) .\nthis may imply that the bright lbgs are dominated by galaxies red in the @xmath42 color .\nthe @xmath63 color reflects the shape of uv continuum between @xmath64  for @xmath65 lbgs , @xmath66  for @xmath48 lbgs , @xmath67@xmath68  for @xmath49 lbgs ] and the difference in the color is thought to be caused by various reasons , for example , differences in dust extinction , stellar population , and redshift .\nif the difference in the color is mainly originated from the dust extinction , the boundary of the color , @xmath69 , is estimated to be @xmath70 , following @xcite .\nif this is the case , the brighter lbgs may be dominated by dusty lbgs with @xmath71 .\nnote that in deriving the red and blue lfs , we assume that the completeness and the contamination of these subsamples are the same as for the whole sample .\nwe should point out the possibility that the difference in red and blue lfs comes from a systematic difference in the completeness and contamination factors of the blue and red samples .\nfigure [ fig : corr](a ) shows the sky distribtuion of @xmath4 lbgs in our sample . in this figure\n, we find a somewhat inhomogeneous distribtution of lbgs , especially for bright ( @xmath72 ) ones .\nwe derive the angular two - point correlation function @xmath73 using the estimator defined by @xcite ( see @xcite ) . the resulting angular correlation function for the sample\nis shown in figure [ fig : corr](b).h@xmath74 mpc@xmath75 . ]\nwe fit a power law , @xmath76 , to the data points , and find the slope @xmath77 , which is consistent with those for nearby galaxies , @xmath78 , though the errors in our estimate are large .\nthe best fit value for @xmath79 is @xmath80 in units of arcsec@xmath81 .\nthe two - point angular correlation function is related to the spatial correlation function @xmath82 by an integral equation , the limber transformation @xcite .\nwe apply the limber transformation to the best fit value of @xmath83 with @xmath79 , using the redshift distribution @xmath39 of the lbgs (  [ sec : lbgselection ] ) .\nthe obtained correlation length is @xmath84 mpc .\nthis is twice as large as the correlation length of the dark matter at @xmath45 predicted from an analytic model by @xcite .\nthe difference is thought to be due to the biasing of galaxy distribution , which is characterized by the biasing factor , @xmath85 , as @xmath86 .\nwe obtain a linear bias @xmath87 , which is similar to that found by @xcite for bright @xmath88 lbgs . on the other hand ,\nthe semianalytic models predict much stronger clustering for galaxies ( eg .\n@xcite , @xcite ) .\na further discussion requires a detailed comparison of galaxy properties and selection criteria , between galaxies in the models and lbgs in our sample .    in figure\n[ fig : corr](b ) , we find an excess of @xmath73 at small scales ( @xmath15 ) at @xmath16 significance levels , relative to the best - fit power law .\nthis can be caused by various effects ; for example , galaxy - galaxy mergers , two galaxies within a common dark matter halo , and/or field variance . if we interpret this as galaxy - galaxy mergers of those @xmath1 lbgs , which are classified as bright lbgs with @xmath89 (  [ sec : lumifun ] )\n, we can calculate , following @xcite , the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers as from the observed and expected numbers of galaxy pairs with a separation of @xmath90 ( the projected physical separation corresponds to 7.5 to 20 @xmath11kpc at @xmath65 ) .\nthe resulting value is @xmath91 .\nthis value is significantly smaller than those for intermediate - redshift ( @xmath92 ) galaxies whose @xmath93 at @xmath94 20 @xmath11kpc is @xmath95 ( e.g. @xcite ) .\nbaugh , c.  m. , benson , a.  j. , cole , s. , frenk , c.  s. , & lacey , c.  g.  1999 , , 305 , l21 bruzual a. , g.  & charlot , s.  1993 , , 405 , 538 calzetti , d.  1997 , , 113 , 162 coleman , g. d. , wu , c .- c . , & weedman , d. w.  1980 , , 43 , 393 , a. and lanzetta , k.  m. and yahil , a.  1999 , , 513 , 34 giavalisco , m.  & dickinson , m.  2001 , , 550 , 177 gunn , j. e. & stryker , l. l.  1983 , , 52 , 121 kauffmann , g. , colberg , j.  ; .\nm. , diaferio , a. , & white , s.  d.  m.  1999 , , 307 , 529 landy , s.  d.  & szalay , a.  s.  1993 , , 412 , 64 madau , p. , ferguson , h.  c. , dickinson , m.  e. , giavalisco , m. , steidel , c.  c. , & fruchter , a.  1996 , , 283 , 1388 meurer , g. r. , heckman , t. m. , & calzetti , d.  1999 , , 521 , 64 miyazaki , s. , sekiguchi , m. , imi , k. , okada , nakata , f. & komiyama , y. 1998 , spie , 3355 , 363 ouchi , m. et al .\n2001 , , 558 , l83 ouchi , m. et al . in preparation papovich ,\nc. , dickinson , m. , & ferguson , h. c.  2001 , , in press ( astro -
