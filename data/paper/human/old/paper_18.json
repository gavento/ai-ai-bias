    "article": "describing the laws of physics in terms of underlying symmetries has always been a powerful tool .\nlie algebras and lie superalgebras are central in particle physics , and the space - time symmetries can be obtained by an inn - wigner contraction of certain lie ( super)algebras .\n@xmath0lie algebras @xcite , a possible extension of lie ( super)algebras , have been considered some times ago as the natural structure underlying fractional supersymmetry ( fsusy ) @xcite ( one possible extension of supersymmetry ) . in this contribution\nwe show how one can construct many examples of finite dimensional @xmath0lie algebras from lie ( super)algebras and finite - dimensional fsusy extensions of the poincar algebra are obtained by inn - wigner contraction of certain @xmath0lie algebras .\nthe natural mathematical structure , generalizing the concept of lie superalgebras and relevant for the algebraic description of fractional supersymmetry was introduced in  @xcite and called an @xmath0lie algebra .\nwe do not want to go into the detailed definition of this structure here and will only recall the basic points , useful for our purpose .\nmore details can be found in  @xcite .\nlet @xmath5 be a positive integer and @xmath6 .\nwe consider now a complex vector space @xmath7 which has an automorphism @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 .\nwe set @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath14 of @xmath8 ) .\nhence , @xmath15 we say that @xmath7 is an @xmath0lie algebra if :    1 .\n@xmath16 , the zero graded part of @xmath7 , is a lie algebra .\n@xmath17 @xmath18 , the @xmath19 graded part of @xmath7 , is a representation of @xmath16 .\n3 .   there are symmetric multilinear @xmath20equivariant maps @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath0fold symmetric product of @xmath23 . in other words , we assume that some of the elements of the lie algebra @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath0th order symmetric products of `` more fundamental generators '' .\n4 .   the generators of @xmath7 are assumed to satisfy jacobi identities ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath11 ) : @xmath26,b_3\\right ] + \\left[\\left[b_2,b_3\\right],b_1\\right ] + \\left[\\left[b_3,b_1\\right],b_2\\right ] = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\\n\\left[\\left[b_1,b_2\\right],a_3\\right ] + \\left[\\left[b_2,a_3\\right],b_1\\right ] + \\left[\\left[a_3,b_1\\right],b_2\\right ]   = 0,\\nonumber   \\\\ \\left[b,\\left\\{a_1,\\dots , a_f\\right\\}\\right ] = \\left\\{\\left[b , a_1 \\right],\\dots , a_f\\right\\ }   + \\cdots + \\left\\{a_1,\\dots,\\left[b , a_f\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{f+1 } \\left [ a_i,\\left\\{a_1,\\dots , a_{i-1 } , a_{i+1},\\dots , a_{f+1}\\right\\ } \\right ] = 0 .\n\\label{rausch : eq : jac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first three identities are consequences of the previously defined properties but the fourth is an extra constraint .\nmore details ( unitarity , representations , _ etc .\n_ ) can be found in  @xcite .\nlet us first note that no relation between different graded sectors is postulated .\nsecondly , the sub - space @xmath27 @xmath28 is itself an @xmath0lie algebra . from now on ,\n@xmath0lie algebras of the types @xmath29 will be considered .\nmost of the examples of @xmath0lie algebras are infinite dimensional ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .\nhowever in @xcite an inductive theorem to construct finite - dimensional @xmath0lie algebras was proven : + * theorem 1 *    _ let @xmath30 be a lie algebra and @xmath31 a representation of @xmath30 such that _\n\\(i ) @xmath32 is an @xmath0lie algebra of order @xmath33;. in this case the notion of graded @xmath34lie algebra has to be introduced @xcite .\n@xmath35 , is a graded @xmath34lie algebra if ( i ) @xmath36 a lie algebra and @xmath31 is a representation of @xmath36 isomorphic to the adjoint representation , ( ii ) there is a @xmath37 equivariant map @xmath38 such that @xmath39 + \\left[f_2 , \\mu(f_1 ) \\right ] = 0 , f_1,f_2 \\in \\ { g}_1 $ ] . ]\n\\(ii ) @xmath40 admits a @xmath41equivariant symmetric form @xmath42 of order @xmath43 .\nthen @xmath44 admits an @xmath0lie algebra structure of order @xmath45 , which we call the @xmath0lie algebra induced from @xmath46 and @xmath42 .\n+ by hypothesis , there exist @xmath47equivariant maps @xmath48 and @xmath49 .\nnow , consider @xmath50 defined by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the group of permutations on @xmath54 elements . by construction , this is a @xmath47equivariant map from @xmath55 , thus the three first jacobi identities are satisfied .\nthe last jacobi identity , is more difficult to check and is a consequence of the corresponding identity for the @xmath0lie algebra @xmath46 and a factorisation property ( see @xcite for more details ) .\nan interesting consequence of the theorem of the previous section is that it enables us to construct an @xmath0lie algebras associated to _\nany _ lie ( super)algebras .\nconsider the graded @xmath34lie algebra @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a lie algebra , @xmath58 is the adjoint representation of @xmath57 and @xmath59 is the identity .\nlet @xmath60 be a basis of @xmath57 , and @xmath61 the corresponding basis of @xmath58 .\nthe graded @xmath34lie algebra structure on @xmath7 is then :    @xmath62 = f_{ab}^{\\ \\ \\ c } j_c , \\qquad   \\left[j_a , a_b \\right ] = f_{ab}^{\\ \\ \\ c } a_c , \\qquad \\mu(a_a)= j_a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 are the structure constants of @xmath57 , the second ingredient to construct an @xmath0lie algebra is to define a symmetric invariant form on @xmath64 .\nbut on @xmath64 , the adjoint representation of @xmath65 , the invariant symmetric forms are well known and correspond to the casimir operators @xcite .\nthen , considering a casimir operator of order @xmath66 of @xmath67 , we can induce the structure of an @xmath0lie algebra of order @xmath68 on @xmath69 .\none can give explicit formulae for the bracket of these @xmath0lie algebras as follows .\nlet @xmath70 be a casimir operator of order @xmath66 ( for @xmath71 , the killing form @xmath72 is a primitive casimir of order two ) .\nthen , the @xmath0bracket of the @xmath0lie algebra is    @xmath73    for the killing form this gives    @xmath74    if @xmath75 , the @xmath0lie algebra of order three induced from the killing form is the @xmath0lie algebra of @xcite .\nthe construction of @xmath0lie algebras associated to lie superalgebras is more involved .\nwe just give here a simple example ( for more details see @xcite ) : the @xmath0lie algebra of order @xmath76 @xmath77 induced from the ( i ) lie superalgebra @xmath78 and ( ii ) the quadratic form @xmath79 , where @xmath8 is the invariant symplectic form on @xmath80 and @xmath81 the invariant symplectic form on @xmath82 .\nlet @xmath83 be a basis of @xmath84 and @xmath85 be a basis of @xmath86 .\nlet @xmath87 be a basis of @xmath88 .\nthen the four brackets of @xmath7 take the following form    @xmath89    it is interesting to notice that this @xmath0lie algebra admits a simple matrix representation @xcite : @xmath90 and @xmath91 .\nit is well known that supersymmetric extensions of the poincar algebra can be obtained by inn - wigner contraction of certain lie superalgebras . in fact\n, one can also obtain some fsusy extensions of the poincar algebra by inn - wigner contraction of certain @xmath0lie algebras as we now show with one example @xcite .\nlet @xmath92 be the real @xmath0lie algebra of order three induced from the real graded @xmath34lie algebra @xmath93 and the killing form on @xmath94 ( see eq .\n[ eq:3-lie ] ) . using vector indices of @xmath95 coming from the inclusion @xmath96 ,\nthe bosonic part of @xmath97 is generated by @xmath98 , with @xmath99 and the graded part by @xmath100 .\nletting @xmath101 after the inn - wigner contraction ,    @xmath102{\\lambda } } q_{\\mu \\nu } , &   j_{4 \\mu } \\to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{\\lambda } } q_{\\mu } , \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one sees that @xmath103 and @xmath104 generate the @xmath105 poincar algebra and that @xmath106 are the fractional supercharges in respectively the adjoint and vector representations of @xmath107 .\nthis @xmath0lie algebra of order three is therefore a non - trivial extension of the poincar algebra where translations are cubes of more fundamental generators .\nthe subspace generated by @xmath108 is also an @xmath0lie algebra of order three extending the poincar algebra in which the trilinear symmetric brackets have the simple form :    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the minkowski metric .\nin this paper a sketch of the construction of @xmath0lie algebras associated to lie ( super)algebras were given .\nmore complete results , such as a criteria for simplicity , representation theory , matrix realizations _ etc .\n_ , was given in @xcite .\n9 rausch de traubenberg m and slupinski m.  j. 2000 j. math .\nphys 41 4556 -
