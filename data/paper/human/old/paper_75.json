    "abstract": " @xmath0-mode of polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background is a unique and nearly direct probe of primordial inflation , which can constrain the amplitude of the primordial gravity waves . \n however , its detection and precise measurement is made difficult by a minute amplitude of the signal , which has to be discerned from many contributions of non - cosmological origin and reliable estimated in the presence of numerous sources of statistical uncertainties . among these latter , the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage , arising as a result of partial sky coverage , has been found to play a key and potentially fundamental role in determining the possible statistical significance with which the primordial @xmath0-mode signal can be detected . in this work \n we employ the pure - pseudo formalism devised to minimise the effects of the leakage on the variance of power spectrum estimates and discuss the limits on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 , that could be realistically set by current and forthcoming measurements of the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum . \n we compare those with the results obtained using other approaches : nave mode - counting , minimum - variance quadratic estimators , and re - visit the question of optimizing the sky coverage of small - scale , suborbital experiments in order to maximize the statistical significance of the detection of @xmath2 . \n we show that the optimized sky coverage is largely insensitive to the adopted approach at least for reasonably compact sky patches . \n we find , however , that the mode - counting overestimates the detection significance by a factor @xmath3 as compared to the lossless maximum variance approach and by a factor @xmath4 as compared to the lossy pure pseudo - spectrum estimator . in a second time \n , we consider more realistic experimental configurations . with a pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath0-modes and considering only statistical uncertainties , we find that a detection of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 at 99% of confidence level is within the reach of current sub - orbital experiments , future arrays of ground - based telescopes and a satellite mission , respectively . \n this means that an array of telescopes could be sufficient to discriminate between large- and small - field models of inflation , even if the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is consistently included but accounted for in the analysis . \n however , a satellite mission will be required to distinguish between different small - field models depending on the number of e - folds .

    "article": "primordial gravity waves are expected to be produced during cosmic inflation in addition to scalar perturbations .\nif indeed present , they would leave a characteristic footprint on the polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as they are considered to be essentially the sole source of the so - called primordial @xmath0-mode residing at the super - horizon scales at the time of the last scattering .\na detection of the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum at large angular scales would be then treated as a smoking gun of inflation , while a precise measurement of its amplitude would constrain the energy scale of inflation , or , geometrically speaking , the expansion rate of the universe during inflation @xcite .\nthis amplitude is expressed by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 , defined as the relative power of primordial gravity waves with respect to that of the scalar perturbations at some pivot scale @xmath8 , chosen here to be equal to @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 .\ncurrently , the most stringent upper bound on @xmath2 using temperature anisotropies has been derived by the planck  collaboration : @xmath11 at 95% cl @xcite , while a recent joint analysis of the planck  and  polarized data set an upper limit @xmath12 at 95% cl @xcite .\nthe measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 could allow to discriminate between different inflationary models .\nin particular , if this upper bound @xmath13 is indeed realized in nature , this would imply a rather high amount of primordial gravity waves thus favoring large - fields inflationary models @xcite .    at smaller angular scales , the @xmath0-mode is dominated by the lensing induced signal .\nthis signal is generated by the gravitational lensing of the cmb photons due to the large scale structure @xcite .\nthe lensing contribution is well - understood from a theoretical point of view and can be uniquely predicted given the primary @xmath1-modes anisotropies and the lensing deflection field @xcite .\nsuch predictions have been been recently confirmed by the sptpol  @xcite and polarbear  experiments  @xcite , with also constraints on the cmb lensing @xmath0-mode power spectrum  @xcite . the lensing @xmath0-mode signal does not depend on @xmath2 .\nit therefore acts as a source of an additional noise masking the primordial , @xmath2-dependent @xmath0-mode , and making its detection more difficult . striving for a detection of @xmath2 ,\none has to either try to remove this lensing signal  @xcite or rely solely on the large angular scales . in this latter case\ntwo features of the primordial @xmath0-mode spectrum are of particular interest as they are anticipated to be particularly prominent .\nthese are so - called reionization and recombination bumps peaking at @xmath14 and at @xmath15 , respectively .\n+ measuring @xmath0-mode is made even more difficult by the fact that measurements as performed by the majority of current experiments , which scan the sky in order to produce its maps , are straightforwardly expressed only in terms of the stokes parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .\nthe @xmath1- and @xmath0-mode are mathematically related to the stokes parameters  @xcite and can be therefore recovered from the observational data .\nthis however is only simple , if full - sky data were available .\nin contrast , realistic cmb experiments provide maps of polarized anisotropies , which only cover a reduced fraction of the celestial sphere , ranging from @xmath18 for balloon - borne and ground - based experiments to @xmath19 for satellite missions . in the context of pseudospectrum estimation of the angular power spectra on an incomplete sky part of the @xmath1-mode signal\nis unavoidably mislabelled as @xmath0-modes and vice verse .\nthough such leakages can be corrected on average , the leaked signal inevitably contributes to the sampling variance of the other reconstructed spectrum .\nthis dramatically increases the uncertainties of the estimated @xmath0-mode spectrum since the cosmological @xmath1-mode is expected to be at least two orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath0-mode in terms of their power spectrum  @xcite .\nthe nature of the leakages and approaches to their removal were investigated in ref .\n@xcite and a relevant pseudospectrum estimator , referred to as the pure pseudospectrum estimator , was proposed subsequently in ref .\nthis estimator has been thoroughly investigated and extended to include an optimization of the sky apodization  @xcite , cross - spectrum approaches  @xcite , and , @xmath20 and @xmath21 cross - correlations  @xcite .\nalternative constructions of pseudospectrum estimators correcting for @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakages have been also proposed  @xcite .\nnevertheless , the pure pseudospectrum method has been found the most mature and efficient one , particularly due to its ability of optimizing the sky apodizations  @xcite , making it a method of choice for many practical applications .\nit is worth pointing out that the leakages are indeed ubiquities and correcting for them is as mandatory for small - scale experiments , covering @xmath18 of the sky , as for satellite - like missions , with access to as much as @xmath19 of the sky  @xcite .\nthough the impact of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage on the variance of the @xmath0-mode power spectrum is generally acknowledged , it is rarely included in projecting performance of planned cmb experiments or instrumental concepts from the point of view of their setting constraints on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 .\ninstead , the major body of work ( see  @xcite for some recent examples ) in this area is based on simplified mode - counting arguments ( see , however e.g. ,  @xcite for some exceptions ) .\nthis stemmed mostly from the practical reasons , as the impact of the leakage is neither calculable analytically nor analysis method independent .\n+ the objective of this work is to fill this gap and present a more systematic study of the impact of the presence of the leakage on the performance forecasts of cmb b - mode experiments .\nthe paper consists of two parts . in the first part , sec .\n[ sec : cap ] , we consider idealized observations of azimuthally symmetric sky areas with homogenous noise and study differences between performance forecasts derived applying three different approaches for different assumed sky area sizes .\nsubsequently , from these three different perspectives we revisit the issue of the optimal sky area , which would permit setting the most stringent constraints on the scalar - to - tensor ratio , @xmath2 , given a fixed length and sensitivity of the experiment .    in the second part ,\n[ sec : realistic ] , we complete those considerations by discussing more realistic sky areas defined for three types of experiments : small - scale observations covering @xmath22% of the sky , an array of ground - based telescope covering @xmath23% and a satellite - like mission capable of delivering up to @xmath24% of the foreground clean sky .\nour conclusions are drawn out in sec . [\nsec : conclu ] , where we also briefly sketch the implications for constraining inflationary models .    throughout this work\nwe neglect complications such as polarized diffuse foregrounds , e.g. ,  @xcite and account for resolved points sources only by appropriately tailoring the adopted mask .\nwe also assume that no subtraction of the lensing @xmath0-mode has been attempted  @xcite .\nwe consider first the case of small - scale experiments in an idealized way .\nthe observed part of the celestial sphere is assumed to be azimuthally symmetric , given by a spherical cap .\nwe however let vary the sky coverage from 0.5% to 10% .\nthe noise is an homogeneous , white noise , and its level is fixed at @xmath25k - arcminute for @xmath26 ( a typical level for ongoing small - scale experiments ) . for a fixed sensitivity and a fixed time of observation , the noise level ( in @xmath27k - arcminute )\nscales as : @xmath28}{1\\%}}\\times n_p(1\\%).\\ ] ] the instrumental noise reprojected on the sky thus varies from @xmath29k - arcminute to @xmath30k - arcminute for an observed fraction of the sky of 0.5% and 10% , respectively .\nfinally , the angular resolution is given by an azimuthally symmetric , gaussian beam with a width of 8 arminutes .\nwe subsequently investigate the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath31 , as a function of the sky coverage .\nthis will be done considering four values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .\nwe note that the last two values are disfavored by the current data , nevertheless we include them in our considerations as they are useful in demonstrating some of the effects we describe hereafter .      translating the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum reconstruction into error bars on the measured tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath34 , can be done using a fisher matrix formalism .    for the rather small observed fractions of the celestial sphere\nhere - considered , the @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum is reconstructed within bandpowers , labelled @xmath35 hereafter , with bandwidths @xmath36 .\nthe binned power spectrum is given by @xmath37 , where the binning operator is defined as : @xmath38 ( our specific choice of the binning will be given in sec .\n[ ssec : powspec ] . )\nthe error bars on @xmath2 are then derived from the fisher matrix via : @xmath39 with @xmath40 , which stands for the covariance matrix of the reconstructed , binned angular power spectrum of the @xmath0-mode .\n( note that @xmath41 denotes the _ estimator _ of the angular power spectrum , @xmath42 . )\nthe @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum as a function of @xmath2 is modeled as : @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 two fiducial angular power spectra , which do not depend on @xmath2 .\nthe former is just obtained as the contribution of primordial gravity waves for @xmath46 ( taking into account that the primordial @xmath0-mode is itself lensed ) .\nthe latter corresponds to the contribution of primary @xmath1-mode transferred into @xmath0-mode because of the gravitational lensing of large scale structures .\nwe do not consider here a potential _ delensing _ of the @xmath0-mode anisotropies , and such a contribution will be assumed to act as an additional gaussian noise for the measurement of @xmath2 .\nthis is a simplifying assumption since the lensing - induced @xmath0-mode is non - gaussian leading to an additional , non - gaussian contribution to the covariance @xcite .\ngaussianity remains however a good approximation for bandpowers which are narrow enough ( @xmath47 ) @xcite , which is the case in our study .\nthe covariance matrix @xmath48 is estimated using three different approaches , as described here .\nfirst , we rely on a nave mode - counting expression ( or so - called @xmath49-formula ) . in this case\n, the covariance on @xmath50 is approximated by : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the noise power spectrum , @xmath53 the beam of the telescope , and , @xmath49 the portion of the celestial sphere , which is observed ( or kept in the analysis ) .\nthe noise power spectrum scales linearly with the sky coverage .\nthe covariance matrix for the binned power spectrum is thus given by : @xmath54\\delta_{b , b'}.       \\label{eq : mcountcov}\\ ] ] this is essentially used as a benchmark as such an evaluation of the statistical error bars on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction underestimates the error bars coming from any numerical methods to be applied to the data .\nsecond we consider the error bars that could be incurred by using a minimum variance quadratic estimator @xcite .\nthe estimator is defined as follows : @xmath55-\\tilde{n}_{\\ell'}\\right\\}.      \\label{eq : copt}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath56 is the covariance matrix of the maps of the stokes parameter , and @xmath57 is the column vector composed of @xmath58 ( the trace operation is across pixels ) . the quantity @xmath59 stands for the noise debias . finally , @xmath60 is the fisher information matrix given by : @xmath61 .\n\\label{eq : fishopt}\\ ] ] it is then shown that the covariance of the above estimator is given by the inverse of the fisher matrix , i.e. @xmath62 .\nwe remind that this estimator is precisely built to be the quadratic estimator with the lowest variance .\nif the @xmath0-mode power spectrum is indeed estimated for each multipole , @xmath63 ( that is chosing @xmath64 ) , this directly gives the following expression for the error bars expected on @xmath2 : @xmath65,\\ ] ] with @xmath66 the same covariance matrix _ but _ assuming that only @xmath67 does depend on @xmath2 , in line with our approach consisting in constraining the tensor - to - scalar ratio from the @xmath0-mode s measurements only given by : @xmath68,\\ ] ] with @xmath69 the covariance matrix assuming that all the angular power spectra do depend on @xmath2 , the equation ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is therefore replaced by : @xmath70 in the above , the indices @xmath71 runs over @xmath72 and @xmath21 .\nthe equation ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is finally obtained assuming that only @xmath67 in @xmath69 does depend on the tensor - to - scalar ratio . ] . in the case of azimuthally symmetric patches , the numerical computation of such fisher matrices ( either @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) ,\ncan be performed in a reasonable time using the expression found in the appendix f of ref .\n@xcite , and by using the s@xmath75hat package to perform spherical harmonic transforms @xcite .\n( the use of this massively parallel package allows for a rapid computation of the covariance matrix for large sky coverages . ) . in the standard case , for brute force calculation\nthe fisher matrix requires @xmath76 operations to be evaluated , but in this calculation , evaluating the spin harmonics by recursion in @xmath63 makes the computational cost as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of rings actually used .    practically speaking , one should nonetheless include the impact of binning , done as follows .\nfirst one defines the so - called _ optimal pseudospectrum _ : @xmath79-\\tilde{n}_{\\ell}.\\ ] ] one easily checks that @xmath80 ( where we also include the impact of an azimuthally symmetric beam ) .\none then introduces the matrix : @xmath81 with the interpolation operator , @xmath82 : @xmath83 the binned estimator , @xmath84 , is finally defined as : @xmath85 with @xmath86 the binned , optimal pseudospectrum . from that last definition , and making use of eqs .\n( [ eq : copt ] ) and ( [ eq : fishopt ] ) , it is straightforward to show that : @xmath87_{bb_1}\\left[p_{b_1\\ell_1}~\\mathbf{f}_{\\ell_1\\ell'_1}~p_{b'_1\\ell'_1}\\right][(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}^{-1})^\\dag]_{b'_1b ' } ,       \\label{eq : qmlcov}\\ ] ] where summations over repeated indices ( i.e. @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) is implicitly assumed , and @xmath90 means the transpose operation .\n+ we note that this way of estimating the uncertainties on the power spectrum reconstruction is also relevant for maximum - likelihood approaches , see e.g. ref .\n@xcite .\nthird , we make use of the x@xmath75pure code and monte - carlo simulations to estimate the covariance matrix expected for the pure pseudospectrum approach\n. details on the pure pseudospectrum estimator can be found in refs .\n@xcite . in practice\n, the power spectrum is estimated within bandpower and the covariance matrix reconstructed from the mc simulations is directly @xmath91 .\nthe numerical cost of this scales as @xmath92 , allowing for rapid mc simulations .    for each sky coverage and for each value of @xmath2 here -\nconsidered , we compute optimized sky apodizations to apply to the maps of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . those optimized sky apodizations are described in refs . @xcite and they allow for having the smallest error bars on the @xmath0-mode power spectrum reconstruction within the context of pure pseudospectrum techniques .\nthose sky apodizations are a set of spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 window functions to be applied to the maps of the stokes parameter .\nthey can be interpreted as the window functions , which make the pure pseudospectrum estimator as close as possible to the minimum - variance quadratic estimator @xcite .\nnumerically speaking , computing those optimized sky apodizations may be long , especially for intricate shape of the observed region and/or low level of noise . using an iterative method ,\nthe numerical cost is @xmath93 , with @xmath94 a number of iterations ranging from few tens to few hundreds for simple patch geometry and noise level considered here ( see sec .\niii in @xcite ) .\nwe stress that for a given sky patch , those sky apodizations are to be optimized for each value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio and bin - by - bin . taking into account the number of bins ( see sec .\n[ ssec : powspec ] ) , the number of sky fractions and the number of values of @xmath2 , which are sampled in this study , this means that 1664 of such sky apodizations have to be computed .\nfortunately , in the case of homogeneous noise and patches with relatively simple contours ( which is obviously the case for a spherical cap ) , it was demonstrated in ref .\n@xcite that an approximated but numerically fast computation of those sky apodizations in the harmonic domain is possible , and indeed leads to error bars equal to those obtained thanks to a direct , pixel - based computation of the optimized sky apodizations .\nthe numerical cost of this technique is reduced to @xmath92 which allows us to derive optimized sky apodizations for each value of the sky coverage , and for each value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .\nour chosen bandpowers for reconstructing @xmath67 are the following .\nthe first bin starts at @xmath95 and we use a constant bandwidth , @xmath96 .\nour last bin extends up to @xmath97 .\nthe value of the maximum multipole is chosen in order to include all the relevant contributions from the primordial @xmath0-mode , that is until the lensing @xmath0-mode be the dominant contribution to the total @xmath0-mode power .\nin addition , for the experimental cases under consideration in this paper , we use beamwidths up to 8 arcminutes , corresponding to a cut - off of @xmath98 .\nthe choice of the bandwidth is mainly motivated by the use of the pure pseudospectrum estimator .\nespecially , it is mandatory for the numerical inversion of the mode - mixing matrices to be possible .\nwe also note that the bandwidth is wide enough so that the correlations between different bins are nearly uncorrelated in the covariance of pure pseudospectrum estimator .\nwe discuss the role of the bin width later on .\nwe stress that the multipoles ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath95 ( corresponding to the reionization peak , and gathered in one bandpower ) are actually used in the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of @xmath67 . however , given the limited sky coverages considered here such low multipoles are difficult to estimate and hardly constrained by the data .\nthis bin is therefore not included in our analysis of the signal - to - noise ratio .    the uncertainties on the estimated power spectrum of the @xmath0-mode as functions of the sky fraction ,\nare shown in fig .\n[ fig : powunc1 ] where four selected values of the sky coverage are depicted : 1% , 3.5% , 7% and 10% .\nthe tensor - to - scalar ratio chosen for this figure is @xmath101 .\neach panel corresponds to a different approach to derive the covariance matrix , @xmath91 : mode - counting , minimum variance quadratic estimator , and , pure pseudospectrum estimator ( from left to right ) .\nas expected , we do observe that the lowest error bars are the ones from the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties , while the highest error bars are obtained from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator .\nthe error bars from the minimum variance , quadratic estimator lie between those two . at the largest accessible scales , @xmath102 , the error bars from the pure pseudospectrum estimator\nare @xmath4 greater than the optimistic mode - counting estimation .\nsimilarly , the error bars from the pure pseudospectrum estimators are at most @xmath103 higher than the ones derived from the minimum variance , quadratic estimators . at the smaller angular scales where lensing dominates , the three approaches lead to almost the same uncertainties .\n+ the behaviour of the uncertainties as a function of the sky fraction is common to the three approaches . at the smaller angular scales\nfirst ( for multipoles greater than @xmath104 ) , the behavior is monotonic since the uncertainties systematically increase with the value of @xmath49 .\nthis is because at these scales , the variance is dominated by the noise , which increases with the sky fraction . at larger scales\nhowever ( for multipoles smaller than @xmath104 ) , the uncertainties have a more intricate behaviour .\nfirst one notes that the uncertainties _ decrease _ from @xmath26 to @xmath105 .\nthis is because the variance is dominated by sampling variance , which decreases for higher values of @xmath49 .\nsecond , one notes that uncertainties at @xmath106 then _ increases _ for a sky coverage ranging from @xmath107 to 10% .\nthis means that for @xmath108 , the noise is now dominating the variance .\nonce this transition value of @xmath109 is crossed , the noise contribution dominates the variance for all our considered angular scales , @xmath110 $ ] .\ntherefore , the variance will monotonically increase with @xmath49 at all the relevant angular scales once @xmath108 .\n( note that an identical behaviour is observed for the other values of @xmath2 , though the specific value of @xmath49 at which the transition occurs depends on the specific value of @xmath2 . )\nthe signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 is computing using eq .\n( [ eq : fisher ] ) considering the three above - described methods to estimate the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction , @xmath91 .\nwe remind that the summation in ( [ eq : fisher ] ) is performed over bandpowers with a bandwidth of @xmath96 and considering a range of multipoles from @xmath95 to @xmath97 .\nour numerical results on the signal - to - noise ratio for @xmath2 are gathered in fig .\n[ fig : snrfsky ] , showing @xmath111 as a function of the sky coverage .\neach panel corresponds to a given value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath32 , and , @xmath33 ( from top to bottom ) . for each panel ,\nthe black , red , and blue crosses correspond to the signal - to - noise ratio derived by using the mode - counting , the minimum variance quadratic estimator , and , the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator , respectively .\nthe horizontal , dashed line marks a @xmath112 detection .\nthe sky fraction varies from 0.1% to 10% , what is wide enough to sample the maximal values of the signal - to - noise ratio .\nwe note that the signal - to - noise ratio keeps decreasing for @xmath113 .\nthis is because for the level of noise and values of @xmath2 here considered , the uncertainties on the reconstructed @xmath0-mode are noise dominated at all scales for @xmath113 .\nsimilarly , the ( s / n)@xmath114 keeps decreasing for @xmath115 , because the uncertainties on angular scales greater than a degree are dominated by the sampling variance for such low values of the sky fraction .\n+     from @xmath0-mode polarization data shown as a function of the sky coverage .\nthe uncertainties are computed using three different approaches : mode -

to - scalar ratio .\nconsidering then the case of the minimum variance , quadratic estimator , the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 is systematically greater than 3 for @xmath116 and @xmath33 . for a tensor - to - scalr ratio of @xmath117 , the ( s / n)@xmath114 is greater or equal to three for @xmath118 .\nassuming finally a pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode , the signal - to - noise ratio is systematically greater than 3 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 only . for a tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath101 , a measurement of it with a ( s / n)@xmath114 of at least 3 , is possible for @xmath121 .\nfor a smaller value of @xmath117 , its measurement with ( s / n)@xmath122 is possible assuming @xmath123 .\nwe note however here that for @xmath117 and @xmath101 , the signal - to - noise ratios remains greater than 2 assuming a pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath42 . +\nas expected from the error bars on the reconstructed @xmath0-mode , the highest and lowest ( s / n)@xmath114 s are respectively obtained from the mode - counting estimation , and the pure pseudospectrum estimator , while the ( s / n)@xmath114 from the minimum variance quadratic estimator lies between those two .\nthis is the case for all the values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio we consider . at the peak ,\nthe signal - to - noise ratio from the pure pseudospectrum estimation of the @xmath42 is @xmath12415% ( @xmath120 ) to @xmath12420% ( @xmath117 ) smaller than the signal - to - noise ratio derived from the optimistic mode - counting .\nthis means that the statistical significance on the measurement of @xmath2 by using the optimistic mode - counting is overestimated by a factor @xmath4 as compared to the more realistic case of the pure pseudoreconstruction of the @xmath0-mode .    similarly , the ( s / n)@xmath114 from the pure pseudospectrum estimator is @xmath1241.5% ( @xmath120 ) to @xmath1248% ( @xmath117 ) smaller than the signal - to - noise ratio derived from the minimum variance , quadratic estimator . using the minimum variance ,\nquadratic estimator to estimate the @xmath0-mode , as compared to the use of the pure pseudospectrum , thus translates into a gain in the statistical significance on the measurement of @xmath2 , of a factor 1.01 to 1.08 .\nthis gain appears rather small but is larger for smaller values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .      as clearly shown in figs .\n[ fig : snrfsky ] , there exists a value of the sky coverage , which maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 .\nthis _ optimal _ value of @xmath49 was already observed in ref .\n@xcite , using only the mode - counting expression for the statistical error bars on the @xmath0-mode estimation though .\nwe found that such an optimal value also exists using the minimum variance quadratic estimator or the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator .\nthis is intuitively understood as follows .\nthe _ statistical _ uncertainties on the angular power spectrum estimation have two sources , the sampling variance , which is dominant at the largest angular scales , and the noise variance dominating at the smallest angular scales . reducing the sampling variance\nis obtained by covering a large fraction of the sky .\nhowever , for a given sensitivity and a given time of observation , covering a large fraction of the sky inevitably translates into a higher level of noise per pixel .\none should therefore find the good balance between sampling and noise variance so as to minimize the total error on given targetted parameters , which is @xmath2 here .\nthe salient features of those results are summarized in the table [ tab : fsky ] . for each value of the tensor -

to - noise ratio , ( s / n)@xmath126 is also reported in this table . we stress that the position of the peak of ( s / n)@xmath114 is well defined for the mode - counting and the minimum variance , quadratic estimator . such a position of the peaking signal - to - noise ratio is however less pronounced for the case of the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of the @xmath0-mode ( see e.g. the case @xmath127 for which a range of @xmath128 leads roughly to the same ( s / n)@xmath114 ) .\nthis means that the values of @xmath125 reported in tab .\n[ tab : fsky ] for the case of the pure pseudospectrum approach are more indicative than a sharply defined value .\n+    lm0.5cmm0.75cmm0.75cmm0.75cmm0.75 cm @xmath2 & & 0.07 & 0.1 & 0.15 & 0.2 + @xmath129 $ ] : & & & & & + mode -

to - scalar ratio . this is because for higher values of @xmath2 , the signal in the @xmath0-mode is higher .\none should therefore minimize first the sampling variance by increasing the observed part of the sky .\n+ except for the case of @xmath120 , we note that the optimal sky coverage assuming a minimum variance , quadratic estimator slightly differs by 0.5% ( either higher or lower ) than the value of @xmath130 ( in % ) as inferred from the mode - counting .\nwe also note that the optimal sky fraction obtained for the pure pseudo-@xmath100 reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode differs by 1% to 1.5% ( depending on the value of @xmath2 ) from the one inferred from the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode .\nnevertheless , the values of the sky fraction for which the detection of the tensor - to - scalar ratio is peaking in the case of the mode - counting expression and the minimum - variance quadratic estimator fall in the range of optimized @xmath49 as derived from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator . those numerical results therefore show that ( at least ) for the range of values of @xmath2 here - considered , the value of the sky coverage , which maximizes the measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio is rather independent on the adopted method for evaluating the statistical uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction .\nthis means that using the mode - counting expression , though underestimating the error bars , allows for a rapid and reliable search of the range of values of the optimized sky fraction .\n( obviously , such an optimization of @xmath49 based on the mode - counting expression is reliable providing the final data set to be analyzed using either the minimum - variance quadratic estimator or the pure pseudospectrum estimator . )      for the two specific cases of the mode - counting uncertainties and the minimum variance , quadratic estimator , we note that an explicit reconstruction of the power spectrum is not mandatory to derive the ( s / n)@xmath114 in the fisher formalism .\none can indeed directly plugged in eq .\n( [ eq : fisher ] ) the formulas ( [ eq : mcountcov ] ) or ( [ eq : qmlcov ] ) .\nthis allows for a study of the impact of binning on the signal - to - noise ratio , letting the bandwidth to vary from @xmath64 ( i.e. no binning ) to @xmath96 ( i.e. the binning imposed by the use of the pseudospectrum estimator in this analysis ) .     as a function of the observed sky fraction , derived for three methods used to estimate the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction : mode - counting ( black area ) , minimum variance quadratic estimator ( red area ) , and , pure pseudospectrum estimator ( blue crosses ) .\nfor the two first methods , we let the bandwidth of the bins to vary from @xmath64 ( highest ( s / n)@xmath114 ) to @xmath96 ( lowest ( s / n)@xmath114 ) . for the specific case of the pure pseudospectrum estimator\n, the reconstruction of the @xmath42 requires to use the bandwidth @xmath96 .\n( we remind that the range of multipoles used to compute the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath131 . ) ]    the impact of binning is illustrated in fig .\n[ fig : snrbin ] showing the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath101 as a function of the sky coverage .\nthe grey ( red ) area corresponds to the ( s / n)@xmath114 using the mode - counting ( minimum variance quadratic estimator ) to estimate the uncertainties the angular power spectrum of the @xmath0-mode . for each shaded area ,\nthe highest signal - to - noise ratio is obtained for @xmath64 and the lowest for @xmath96 . as a reference\n, we also show the ( s / n)@xmath114 obtained with pure pseudospectrum reconstruction ( thus using a bandwidth of @xmath96 ) depicted by the blue crosses . the overall effect of increasing the width of the bandpower is to lower the signal - to - noise ratio .\nthe decrease is however more pronounced for the case of the minimum variance , quadratic estimator than for the mode - counting estimation of the error bars on the reconstructed @xmath0-mode .\nthis is due to the fact that correlations between multipoles ( or bandpowers ) are accounted for in the minimum variance , quadratic estimator , while those are supposed to be systematically vanishing for the mode - counting estimation of the covariance matrix .\nthis additional piece of information contained in the correlations is therefore partially lost by averaging over bandpowers .\nwe also checked that artificially imposing those off - diagonal correlations to be zero lowered the signal - to - noise ratio in the minimum variance method , although we note that once the bins are sufficiently wide the effect of the binwidth on the ( s / n)@xmath114 should be weak .\nthe maximum values of the ( s / n)@xmath114 obtained using a bandwidth of @xmath64 , and a bandwidth of @xmath96 , are reported in tab .\n[ tab : bin ] , for each values of @xmath2 and for the mode - counting and the minimum variance quadratic estimator . for each cases\n, we also report the value of the sky coverage corresponding to that maximum . for the mode - counting approach , increasing the bandwidth from @xmath64 to @xmath96 , degrades the maximum ( s / n)@xmath114 by a factor @xmath132 for @xmath117 and @xmath133 , and , by a factor @xmath134 for @xmath119 and @xmath33 .\nthis however only mildly affects the values of the sky fraction at which the maximum is achieved .\nthe impact of binning is more marked for the minimum variance quadratic estimator however .\nincreasing the bandwidth from @xmath64 to @xmath96 , here degrades the maximum ( s / n)@xmath114 by a factor @xmath135 for all the values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio considered in this study .\nsimilarly , the values of the sky fraction ( in % ) at which this maximum is achieved is systematically lowered ( except for the case @xmath127 ) , by 1% for @xmath101 and by 2% for @xmath120 . we note that despite these changes in the value of @xmath130 with the bandwidth , the optimized values of the sky fraction still fall in the range of optimized @xmath49 as derived from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimator .\n@xmath2 & & 0.07 & 0.1 & 0.15 & 0.2 + ( s / n)@xmath126 and @xmath125 : & & & & & + mode -

in - the - analysis ) portion of the sky ( see e.g. the figure 20 of ref .\n@xcite for the impact of the shape of the mask on the statistical error bars ) .\na spherical cap then leads to the smallest amount of leakages for a given sky fraction since its contour has the smallest perimeter for that given sky fraction . to this end\n, we consider three archetypal cases , which capture the main characteristics of ongoing , or being - deployed , small - scale experiments ( ground - based or balloon - borne ) , a possible upgrade of those ground - based experiments to an array covering a rather large fraction of the sky ( @xmath136 ) , and , a possible satellite mission covering the entire celestial sphere . +    [\ncols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a couple of comments about the numerical computation of the pixel - based , minimum - variance sky apodizations are in order here .\nthey are theoretically built to give the smallest uncertainties in the context of the pure pseudospectrum estimators .\nhowever , they are pratically computed from a preconditionned conjugate gradient ( pcg ) algorithm , which efficiency strongly depends on the experimental configurations , especially with respect to the noise level and its distribution over the patch , as well as with respect to the complexity of the contours of the mask .\nfirst , the number of iterations in our implemented pcg rapidly increases for lower levels of noise : at the largest angular scales ( @xmath137 ) the number of iterations ranges from @xmath104 for a noise level of 5.75@xmath27k - arcminute to @xmath138 for a noise level of 1@xmath27k - arminute ( the number of iterations being one order of magnitude smaller for smaller angular scales , @xmath139 ) .\nthe @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum is estimated using the same binning as in the previous section , leading to @xmath140 , and we selected 6 values of @xmath2 . considering 3 experimental setups , this would translate into @xmath124500 optimized sky apodization to compute , which is numerically too costly .\nwe therefore compute the optimized sky apodization for @xmath141 only but use them for all the here - considered values of @xmath2 , meaning that the signal - to - noise ratios obtained for @xmath142 may be suboptimal within the context of the pure pseudospectrum estimator - modes leaking into the @xmath0-mode , and poorly affected by the amplitude of the primordial @xmath0-mode .\nthis means that the resulting sky apodizations may be mildly dependant on the assumed value of @xmath2 and that the derived signal - to - noise ratios are only slightly suboptimal for the case of small - scale experiments . ] .\nsecond , it is not guaranteed that the algorithm converges towards the optimal solution , especially for inhomogeneous noise ( see sec .\niv c of ref .\n@xcite where it was shown that trimming out the external , noisiest pixels is required ) , or a very low level of noise ( see ref .\n@xcite mentionning that convergence is not reached for a noise level of @xmath143k - arminute , corresponding to the level of the array of telescopes case ) .\nthis means that the performances of those sky apodizations have to be assessed using numerical simulations at the level of power spectrum reconstruction , comparing the resulting error bars on the estimated power spectra to the error bars obtained by using the other types of sky apodizations .\nthe relative performances of the different sky apodizations are appraised at the level of power spectrum uncertainties . for each case\nwe performed a series of 500 monte - carlo simulations to compute the statistical uncertainties on the reconstructed @xmath0-mode angular power spectra , assuming different kinds of sky apodizations .\nsuch performances have been exhaustively studied for the small - scale experiment case and the satellite mission case ( see refs .\n@xcite and ref .\n@xcite , resp . ) . on the contrary , the applicability of the pure pseudospectrum estimator for the case of an array of telescopes was hitherto not studied .\nwe then performed numerical simulations using the different classes of sky apodizations to assess the efficiency of the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode , and subsequently select those sky apodizations , which lead to the smallest uncertainties .    in this section\n, we only briefly review the major conclusions concerning the cases of a small - scale experiment and a satellite mission .\nthen , we present the results of our numerical investigations for the case of an array of telescopes .      for the small - scale experiment case , it was shown that the lowest uncertainties in the range @xmath144 $ ] were obtained using either the pixel - based optimized sky apodizations or analytic sky apodizations appropriately chosen to minimize the variance per each bin\n. however , the harmonic - based computation of the sky apodization fails in providing error bars comparable to the previous ones in the entire range of multipoles considered here , simply because the noise is inhomogeneous .\n( we refer to fig .\n24 of ref .\n@xcite and discussions therein . )    for the satellite mission case , the pixel - based computation of the minimum - variance sky apodization yields the smallest uncertainties for the range @xmath144 $ ] .\nsimilar performance is obtained by using the harmonic - based computation of these sky apodizations for @xmath145 .\nthe error bars however drastically increase for larger angular scales , the reason for that being the intricate contours of the galactic mask and the point - sources mask , which require to relax the neuman and dirichlet boundary conditions to keep ( part of ) the informations about the @xmath0-mode contained in the ambiguous modes .\nfor such a case , analytic sky apodizations fails in providing comparable error bars at the largest angular scales .\n( we refer to fig .\n@xcite and discussions therein . )      for the case of an array of telescopes , we systematically search for the type of sky apodizations , which lead to the smallest uncertainties bin per bin and for each values of @xmath2 considered in this study .\nwe first found that the harmonic - based , optimized sky apodizations yield to error bars higher than the analytic sky apodizations or the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations .\nthis is similar to what was observed for the case of a satellite mission and the inefficiency of the harmonic - based , optimized sky apodizations is due to the complexity of the contours of the mask .\nan example of the uncertainties for @xmath101 and using the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations ( the dashed - red curve ) or the analytic ones for different values of the apodization length ( the dashed - blue curves ) is shown in fig .\n[ fig : clhalfsky ] .\nthe solid - black curve stands for the input angular power spectrum and the dashed - black curve stands for the binned , mode - counting computation of the error bars .\nthis first shows that the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations perform the best at the largest angular scales .\nthis is systematically so for the two first bins . for the third bin ,\nthe pixel - based , sky apodizations and the analytic ones perform the same for @xmath146 , while for @xmath147 , the analytic sky apodizations with an apodization length of 4 degrees lead to a smaller error bar than the pixel - based , optimized sky apodization . however at smaller scales , @xmath148 ,\nthe smallest error bars are systematically obtained by using an analytic sky apodizations with an apodization length of 2 degrees for intermediate scales , @xmath149 , and an apodization length of 1 degree for small scales , @xmath150 .\nwe found this to be independant of the value of @xmath2 ( at least for the grid of values considered here ) .\n+ we note that the apparent failure of the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations here may be rather due to practical difficulties in computing such apodizations sufficiently accurately , rather than an indication of some fundamental problems .\nindeed , we have found that for the noise levels the iterative solver used to compute the apodizations converges extremely slowly ( as also observed in ref .\n@xcite ) potentially preventing us in practice from achieving sufficient precision .\n-mode for the case of an array of telescopes .\nthe solid - black curve stands for the input angular power spectrum with a tensor - to - scalar ratio equal to @xmath101 .\nthe dashed - black curve is for the binned , mode - counting uncertainties used as a benchmark .\nthe error bars obtained by using the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations ( called pcg in the figure legend ) is represented by the dashed - red curve .\nthe different dashed - blue curves correspond to the error bars obtained by using analytic sky apodizations with an apodization length ranging from 1 degree to 6 degrees . ]      as a summary , the smallest statistical uncertainties obtained for @xmath101 are shown in fig .\n[ fig : cellallexp ] in which the orange , red and burgundy curves stand for the small - scale experiment , an array of telescopes and a satellite mission respectively .\nfor each experimental setup , we show the smallest error bars , which are attained for each bandpower . for the cases of a small - scale experiment and a satellite mission , this is obtained by using the pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations throughout the entire range of angular scales . for the case of an array of telescopes ,\nthe pixel - based , optimized sky apodizations are used for multipoles lower than 100 , while analytic sky apodizations with an apodization of 2 degrees and 1 degree are used in the range @xmath151 and in the range @xmath152 , respectively .\n+    -mode s angular power spectra with the pure pseudospectrum estimator .\nthe orange , red and burgundy lines stand for the small - scale experiment , an array of telescopes and a satellite mission respectively .\nthe black line corresponds to the input angular power spectrum for @xmath101 . ]    as expected , the higher uncertainties are the ones from a small - scale experiment due to the tiny fraction of the sky it covers , and the relatively high level of instrumental noise .\nwe provide the uncertainties for the first bandpower , @xmath153 , for completeness .\nthese scales are nonetheless unaccessible starting from a map covering 1% of the sky due to the high uncertainties , as already stated in sec .\n[ sec : cap ] .    for angular scales going from @xmath99 to @xmath154 ,\nthe smallest error bars corresponds to a satellite mission .\nthis is because at these angular scales , the uncertainties are dominated by sampling variance and a satellite mission , as compared to an array of telescopes , benefits from its larger sky fraction .\nfor multipoles smaller than @xmath104 , the error bars from a satellite mission are roughly 1.5 to 2 times smaller than the error bars obtained from an array of telescopes , which is in line with the fact that the sky fraction for a satellite mission is 2 times higher than the sky fraction observed by an array of telescopes , thus reducing the error bars by a factor of @xmath155 as compared to the error bars from an array of telescope .\nnevertheless , at small scales , @xmath156 , smaller error bars are obtained from an observation by an array of telescopes .\nthis is because in that regime , the uncertainties for the case of a satellite mission are dominated by the noise term , @xmath157 . since the noise for a satellite mission is four times higher ( in power spectrum ) than the noise for an array of telescopes , and\nthe beam is more than two times higher , this increase of the variance largely overcome the decrease due to a larger sky coverage .\nthis quantitatively explains why at those small angular scales , the lowest error bars on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction are obtained from an array of telescope .\n( one can even notice that for the range of angular scales considered here , the uncertainties obtained for an array of telescopes in sampling variance dominated . )\nthe computation of the signal - to - noise ratio on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is done by using the same fisher matrix formalism as employed in the previous section , eq .\n( [ eq : fisher ] ) . for each experimental configurations and each value of @xmath2 ,\nwe select the smallest error bars we obtained _ bin per bin_. this means that for the specific case of an array of telescope , the estimation of the @xmath0-mode angular power spectra is done by mixing different kind of sky apodizations .\nwe use the same bandpowers as in sec . [\nsec : cap ] and now add the largest angular scales , from @xmath99 to @xmath95 gathered in one single bandpower , in the summation in eq .\n( [ eq : fisher ] ) . adding these scales is relevant for the case of an array of telescopes , and the case of a satellite mission .\nwe will first add this bandpower at the largest scales for the three experimental setups , sec .\n[ sssec : numres ] .\nwe will subsequently study its impact on the measurement of @xmath2 , sec .\n[ sec : firstbin ] .\n( note that we use the binned covariance for both the modecounting and the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath42 . )\nour results on the signal - to - noise ratio for @xmath2 ranging from @xmath158 to @xmath33 are shown in fig .\n[ fig : snrallexp ] ( note that for the specific case of a satellite mission the value @xmath159 has been added in order to fall below the @xmath112 limit ) .\nthe red and black crosses correspond to a covariance matrix computed using the mode - counting expression for error bars on @xmath67 , and the pure pseudospectrum error bars , respectively .\nthe solid red line is the @xmath112 limit .\nthe left panel corresponds to a small - scale experiment covering @xmath1241% of the celestial sphere with a highly inhomogeneous noise distribution .\nthe middle panel corresponds to an array of telescopes covering @xmath12436% of the sky with a low level of ( homogeneous ) noise .\nfinally , the right panel is for a satellite mission covering @xmath12471% of the sky with a low level of homogeneous noise .\n+         for the case of a small - scale experiment , the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 ranges from 0.06 for @xmath160 to 4 for @xmath120 assuming a pure pseudo-@xmath100 reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode power spectrum ( meaning that a `` measurement '' of @xmath160 would be consistent with @xmath161 ) .\nthis has to be compared to what would be inferred from the idealized mode - counting evaluation of the uncertainties , for which the signal - to - noise ratio varies from 0.25 for @xmath160 to 6.7 for @xmath120 . for @xmath162 and @xmath133 ,\nthe ( s / n)@xmath114 derived from a mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode is overestimated by a factor @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , resp .\n, as compared to the ( s / n)@xmath114 obtained from a pure pseudo-@xmath100 reconstruction of the angular power spectrum .    for the case of an array of telescopes and assuming the pure pseudosepctrum estimation of the @xmath0-mode , the signal - to - noise ratio varies from 0.67 to 41 with @xmath2 varying from 0.001 to 0.2 .\nvalues of @xmath166 and @xmath101 would be measured with a statistical significance of 5.75@xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively .\nusing instead the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties on @xmath67 , the ( s / n)@xmath114 varies from 3 to 54 for @xmath2 ranging from 0.001 to 0.2 .\nfor the three selected values of @xmath162 and 0.1 , the signal - to - noise ratio obtained from the mode - counting approach is respectively overestimated by a factor 4.5 , 2.5 and 1.3 , as compared to the realistic ( s / n)@xmath114 derived from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of @xmath67 .    for the case of a satellite mission ,\nthe signal - to - noise ratio varies from 0.66 for @xmath169 to 59 for @xmath120 , and assuming the pure pseudospectrum estimation of @xmath67 .\nthe values of @xmath160 , @xmath166 and @xmath101 would be detected with a statistical significance of 1.34 , 10.84 and 46.19 , respectively .\nif one instead makes use of the mode - counting estimation of the error bars on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction , the ( s / n)@xmath114 varies from 2 to 72 for values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio ranging from 0.0005 to 0.2 . for @xmath162 and @xmath133 ,\nthe mode - counting evaluation overestimates the signal - to - noise ratio , as compared to the pure pseudo-@xmath100 reconstruction , by a factor 2.2 , 1.59 and 1.22 .\n+ from a qualitative viewpoint , the signal - to - noise ratios computed in the framework of the mode - counting expression are always higher compared to the signal - to - noise ratios assuming the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath0-mode .\n( this is obviously expected from the fact that the mode - counting approach is an idealized and _ underestimated _ computation of the uncertainties . )\nwe observe that the overestimation using the mode - counting expression ( as compared to the more realistic pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath67 ) is less marked for higher values of @xmath2 .\nthis behavior is common to the three experimental configurations here - considered , though there are differences from a quantitative viewpoint .\nthe reason is that for low values of @xmath2 , most of the information comes from the largest scales , which is precisely at those large scales that the underestimation of the @xmath0-mode reconstruction using the mode - counting formul  is more marked .\nwe also stress that in the case of mode - counting approach , the leakages are ignored . on the contrary ,\nthe pure pseudospectrum approach consistently includes them but correct them in the analysis .\nthis explains why the mode counting approach overestimate the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 .\ncmb observations covering a large fraction of the sky are automatically contaminated by various astrophysical foregrounds with complex physics involved among which the emission from our galaxy is the strongest .\nmasks are used to remove from the analysis the portion of sky with the highest foreground level , but the foreground emission is present on the entire celestial sphere .\nusually techniques - such as parametric component separation @xcite used to determinate the spectral parameters or template fitting method , which deprojects the template of the foreground from the map @xcite - are used to minimize the impact of the foreground .\nthe residual level of foreground contaminants depends on the technique actually chosen . however , the power spectrum of the galactic dust , polarized emission ( which is the major contaminant of cmb measurements at frequencies above @xmath104ghz ) behaves as @xmath170 , to be compared to @xmath171 for the cmb @xmath0-mode angular power spectrum at scales above a degree @xcite .\nthe impact of such a galactic foreground is therefore expected to be more pronounced at the largest angular scales .    here , we considered the worst case scenario where the foreground contamination could not be removed at all on the largest scale , meaning that the information from the reionization peak is no more taken into account in the computation of the signal - to - noise ratio . in practice\n, we discard the first bin ( @xmath172 ) from the analysis , which necessarily lowers the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 .\nwe define this relative decrease as : @xmath173 with ( s / n)@xmath114 the signal - to - noise on @xmath2 accounting for _ all _ the angular scales , and ( s / n)@xmath174 the signal - to - noise ratio obtained by _ discarding _ the first bandpower .\nthis relative decrease can alternatively be interpreted as the relative contribution from the first bin to the signal - to - noise on @xmath2 since : @xmath175 with ( s / n)@xmath176 the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 that would be obtained by using the first bandpower _ only_. + this relative decrease of ( s / n)@xmath114 is shown in fig . [\nfig : degradesnrallexp ] .\nthe red crosses correspond to the mode - counting estimation of the error bars on the reconstruction of @xmath67 while the black crosses correspond to the error bars from a pure pseudospectrum estimation of @xmath67 .\nthe left , middle and right panels respectively stand for the case of a small - scale experiment , an array of telescopes and a satellite mission .\nthe case of a small - scale experiment is poorly affected by the removal of the first bin using the pure peudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath67 , the relative decrease being systematically smaller than 0.1% .\nthis is because in such a case the signal - to - noise ratio for the first bandpower , @xmath177 , is much smaller than unity for all the values of @xmath2 considered here .\nthis bandpower therefore does not bring any significant amount of informations on @xmath2 .\nthis drastically differs if one uses the mode - counting evaluation for which @xmath178 varies from 0.7% for @xmath120 to 32% for @xmath160 .\nthis is because in this case , the signal - to - noise ratio in the first bandpower , @xmath179 with @xmath153 , becomes greater than unity though the sky coverage is only of @xmath18 .\nthe fact that the relative decrease is more pronounced for small values of @xmath2 is understood as follows . for lower values of @xmath2 , the recombination bump at the degree scale ,\nfalls below the lensing part of the @xmath0-mode while the reionization bump in the first bandpower remains above the lensing signal . as a consequence , the reionization peak carries more information , relative to the informations carried by the recombination peak , for lower values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .    for the case of an array of telescopes ,\nthe relative decrease ranges from 0.4% for @xmath120 to roughly 3% for @xmath160 .\nwe note that this relative decrease is now roughly constant from @xmath160 to @xmath166 and then decreases for higher values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .\nthis behavior of @xmath178 is explained by the very same reason explaining why @xmath178 decreases for higher values of @xmath2 if one makes use of the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties on the estimated @xmath67 , and because for an array of telescopes , the angular power spectrum in the first bandpower can now be measured with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than unity .\nwe note that the relative decrease using the mode - counting behaves the same as in the case of a small - scale experiment ( with minor quantitative differences at high values of @xmath2 ) .    for the case of a satellite mission ,\nthe relative decrease varies from 0.35% for @xmath120 to 9% for @xmath169 , with @xmath180 for @xmath160 .\nthis relative decrease now monotonically increases with lower values of @xmath2 ( though our results suggest that a plateau is reached for @xmath181 ) .\nthis behavior is explained by the same reason explaining the decrease of @xmath178 for higher values of @xmath2 in the case of an array of telescopes .\nwe also note that @xmath178 obtained from the mode - counting expression behaves the same as in the case of a small - scale experiment and an array of telescopes . + as is clear from fig .\n[ fig : degradesnrallexp ] , the shape of @xmath178 as derived using the mode - counting expression , is qualitatively the same for the three experimental configurations , though sky fractions and shapes of the masks drastically change .\nthis is because the impact of the limited sky fraction is simply modelled as an overall renormalization of the error bars , equally applied at all angular scales ( see eq .\n( [ eq : mcount ] ) ) .\nneglecting the noise contribution to the error bars on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction ( which is a relatively fair assumption here ) , it is easy to figure out that this overall @xmath182 does not enter in the final expression of @xmath178 .\n( we note that minor differences are however expected because of the different noise level and beamwidth . ) at low values of @xmath2 , the relative decrease is much less marked in the context of the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of @xmath67 , with respect to the mode - counting expression .\nthis is because the different leakages have stronger impacts at large scales ( in term of increase of the error bars on the estimated @xmath67 ) , thus reducing the relative contribution of the first bandpower to the constraint that can be set on @xmath2 .\nthe impact of leakages in terms of error bars on @xmath67 at large angular scales increases with smaller @xmath49 , which therefore reduces the relative contribution of the first bandpower to the constraints on @xmath2 .\nthis is clearly seen in fig .\n[ fig : degradesnrallexp ] where @xmath178 is more important from the case of a small - experiment , to the case of an array of telescopes , to the case of a satellite mission .      as a result , at a given @xmath2 and considering all the angular scales from 2 to 1020 , the value of the signal - to - noise ratio is the highest in the case of a satellite mission . as an example\n, a tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath183 would be detected at a statistical significance of about @xmath184 . in the case of an array of telescope ,\nthe value of the signal - to - noise ratio remains high for a large range of values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , showing a detection of 28@xmath167 at @xmath185 .\nfinally , a small scale experiment would set mild constraints on low values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , reaching 3@xmath167 at @xmath185 .\n+ in the frame of the primordial @xmath0-mode detection prospects , the minimal value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 that could be detected regarding the experimental setups is a relevant result .\nthe table [ tab : snr ] summarizes in this perspective the aforementioned results , considering a measurement of @xmath2 with at least a 3@xmath167 statistical significance as a threshold .\nthe minimal accessible value of @xmath2 is shown with respect to the experimental setups and the estimation of the @xmath0-mode variance over all the range of multipoles ( referred to as _\ncase a _ in the table ) .\nas explained above , the mode counting estimation of the variance overestimates the forecasts made on the minimal accessible @xmath2 as compared to the realistic @xmath0-mode estimation . in the case of a potential satellite mission for instance ,\nthe lowest accessible @xmath2 we could realistically expect is 2.88 greater than the one estimated using the mode - counting estimation .\nthese results therefore highlight the inaccuracy that an approximative estimation of the @xmath0-mode induces on the performed forecasts of the detectable @xmath2 values . thus considering the realistic forecasts performed thanks to the pure estimation of the @xmath0-mode power spectrum ,\nwe conclude that a satellite mission would give access to the largest range of @xmath2 , with a minimal @xmath2 value of @xmath186 .\na typical small scale experiment is indeed expected to reach only @xmath2 higher than @xmath133 at 3@xmath167 ( note that @xmath141 is detectable at @xmath187 ) . between these two cases\nlies the one of an array of telescopes , which warrants a detection of the tensor - to - scalar ratio if it is higher than @xmath188 . as a result ,\neach studied experiments widens the accessible range of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 . in terms of minimal detectable vlaue of @xmath2 ,\none gains about a factor 20 from small - scale experiments to an array of telescopes , and about a factor 2 between the latter and a satellite mission .\n+    p2.4cmm1.9cmm1.9cmm1.9 cm & small - scale exp .\n& telescopes array & satellite mission + mode -

counting estimated ) error budget varies from few percents to 10% of the lensing signal .\nsumming over the multipoles range thus enables a detection of @xmath204 with a @xmath112 statistical significance .    nonetheless ,\nin this _ case b _ , the orders of magnitude of the realistic forecasts remain unchanged if the @xmath0-mode power spectrum is reconstructed from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 approach .\nthe values of @xmath2 that could be detected at @xmath112 increase by a factor of less than one percent for a small - scale experiment , a factor of few percents for an array of telescopes , and , a factor of ten percents for a satellite mission .\n( this obvisouly reflects the values of @xmath178 found in the previous section , sec .\n[ sec : firstbin ] . )\nthis means that the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of the reionization peak of the @xmath0-mode mildly constraints the tensor - to - scalar ratio . to take full advantages of the range @xmath205 ( so as to lower the minimal detectable value of @xmath2 and to enlarge the lever arm to constraint e.g. the spectral index )\n, one should probably rely on more optimal techniques for reconstructing @xmath67 at those largest angular scales at large scales is also plagued by other sources of uncertainties such as the level of residual foregrounds and/or the impact of filtering of the maps . ] .\nwe have investigated the detection of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath2 , from forthcoming and potential future measurements of the cmb polarized anisotropies .\nwe considered the @xmath0-mode as the main source of information on @xmath2 and assumed the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of its angular power spectra from the maps of stokes @xmath16 and stokes @xmath17 , previously shown to be a method of choice for analyzing coming data sets .\nwe focused on realistic statistical uncertainties ( i.e. sampling and noise variance ) as incurred by such a numerical method , and we purposefully did not consider the potential gain thanks to delensing , nor the loss due to polarized foreground contamination and instrumental systematics .\nwe emphasize that in this paper we consider only the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage due to a cut sky . in cmb practice\nthere are numerous other potential sources of such leakages .\nfor instance , they can arise from instrument limitations , such as beam mismatch  @xcite or polarimeter orientation uncertainty  @xcite , or be generated by data processing , say , via time - domain filtering  @xcite .\nsuch leakages would also have an effect on estimated @xmath0-mode power spectrum .\nthe effect will in general depend on a specific method used for the estimation but also on the detailed nature of the leakage itself , and thus would have to be studied cased by case . in many situations ,\nsuch leakages could be corrected for already on the map - making stage , leaving therefore the cut - sky as the only fundamental source of the leakage to contend with on the power spectrum estimation level as assumed in this work .\nin contrast , we include the effects of the gravitational lensing , i.e. , of the `` cosmological @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage '' , in the total uncertainty budget , in spite of the fact that map - making - level , delensing procedures , which could correct for part of this effect have been proposed  @xcite .\nthe improvements on the detection of @xmath2 those methods could give depend on the noise level and the resolution of the experiment , and , on the potential use of external datasets ( if delensing can not be done internally ) . by including the lensing - induced @xmath0-mode\n, we adopt a more conservative viewpoint as far as forecasts on the tensor - to - scalar ratio are concerned .\n+ in this framework , we first consider the case of small - scale ( either ground - based or balloon - borne ) experiments in an idealized way , assuming the observed sky patch is azimuthally symmetric . we consider four values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and\nlet the sky fraction to vary from 0.5% to 10% ( with a noise level of @xmath206k - arcminute at @xmath26 .\nwe compare the signal - to - noise on @xmath2 as obtained from the pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode to the signal - to - noise ratio that would obtained assuming either the mode - counting estimation of the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode , or a minimum variance , quadratic estimator .\nwe show that the statistical significance on the detection of @xmath2 using the mode - counting is overestimated by a factor @xmath4 as compared to the more realistic case of the pure pseudospectrum estimation .\n( the mode - counting also overestimate this significance by a factor @xmath3 as compared to the minimum variance , quadratic estimator . ) similarly , the ( s / n)@xmath114 obtained from the pure pseudospectrum estimator is reduced by 1.5% ( at @xmath120 ) to 8% ( at @xmath117 ) as compared to the lossless minimum variance , quadratic estimator .    for the case of small - scale experiment\nfor which the reionization bump is not accessible , and in the limitation of azimuthally symmetric patches , the pure pseudospectrum approach for @xmath0-modes reconstruction is thus almost as accurate as the more computationally costly minimum variance , quadratic estimator ( the former scaling as @xmath92 and the latter as @xmath207 if the observed sky patch is not azimuthally symmetric ) . as shown in fig .\n20 of @xcite , non - azimuthal symmetry basically does not change the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction with the pure pseudospectrum estimator ( except for unrealistic , highly squeezed shapes ) .\nwe can thus except this conclusion to holds for more intricate shapes of the observed sky .\nour results ( summarized in tab . [ tab : fsky ] ) show that for a given sensitivity typical of forthcoming small - scale experiments , the value of the sky fraction maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio on @xmath2 is rather insensitive to the method adopted to compute the uncertainties on the reconstructed @xmath67 ( either the mode - counting expression , a minimum - variance quadratic estimator or the pure pseudo-@xmath100 approach ) .\nwe also show that the choice of the bandwidth only mildly affect this optimized sky fraction in the case of the mode - counting approach to estimate the uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction ( see tab . [\ntab : bin ] ) .\nthis means that using the mode - counting expression provide a rather reliable estimate of the optimized sky fraction from the viewpoint of statistical uncertainties though being underestimated .\n+ second , we consider the detection of the tensor - to - scalar ratio for three selected examples , each of them mimicking three archetypal experimental configurations .\nrealistic sky coverage ( with intricate contours ) and realistic noise distribution for the small - scale experimental setup are considered and the statistical uncertainties on the @xmath0-mode reconstruction are derived from the mode - counting expression first ( used as a benchmark ) , and second , from the pure pseudospectrum estimators using optimized sky apodizations .\nour results are summarized in the table [ tab : snr ] . for each experimental setups , it shows the minimal values of @xmath2 that could be measured with at least a statistical significance of @xmath112 .\none gains more than one order of magnitude for the minimal detectable value of @xmath2 from the small - scale experiment to an array of telescopes , and another factor 2 from an array of telescopes to a satellite mission .\nthis conclusion stands even if the largest angular scales ( @xmath208 ) can not be used in the analysis .\nlet us briefly discuss the impact of those results in the context of single - field , slow - roll inflation .\nour purpose here is to give a rough translation of the potential measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio with the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of the @xmath0-mode , into a potential discrimination between small fields and large fields models of inflation .\n( a more detailed study of inflationary models can be found in ref .\n@xcite , though it is restricted to satellite missions and assumes a different evaluation of the error budget for the @xmath0-mode reconstruction . )\nthe tensor - to - scalar ratio is an valuable source of information for the physics of the primordial universe .\nfirst , it is a direct measure of the energy scale of inflation , @xmath209 with @xmath210 the value of the inflaton potential during inflation : @xmath211 this means that a measured value of @xmath212 corresponds to test a physical regime in the playground of grand unified theories .\nsecond , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is directly related to the number of e - folds , @xmath213 , and the excursion of the scalar field , @xmath214 , from the instant when cosmological fluctuations observed in the cmb are created during inflation , to the end of inflation @xcite : @xmath215 with @xmath216 the reduced planck mass .\n( we note that @xmath213 can be determined from the knowledge of the inflaton potential .\nwe however let it free in order not to assume a too specific shape of this potential . )\nsingle field inflationary models can be roughly classified between large fields models and small fields models , whether the excursion of the scalar field is transplanckian or subplanckian , respectively .\nthough the value @xmath217 should not be considered as a sharp and univoquely defined frontier between small fields and large fields models , a precise measure of @xmath2 then allows for discriminating between this two classes of models . for @xmath218 and considering zero runnings of the spectral index ( see @xcite for extensions of the lyth bound with runnings ) , values of @xmath2 greater than @xmath219 would correspond to large fields models of inflation ( see also ref . @xcite and references therein for examples of small fields models evading the lyth bound ) .\n, that could be observed with , at least , a @xmath112 significance , as functions of the number of e - folds during inflation .\ndarker blue to lighter blue respectively stands for small - scale experiment , an array of telescopes and a satellite mission .\nthe minimal , detectable value of @xmath2 at @xmath112 allowing for such a measurement is the one derived from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of the @xmath0-mode angular power spectra . ]\nthe figure [ fig : lyth ] shows the ranges of @xmath220 as a function of @xmath213 accessible assuming that the tensor - to - scalar ratio has been measured with at least a @xmath112 statistical significance .\nblue areas correspond to the accessible range for each experimental configurations ( notice that the higher @xmath214 , the higher @xmath2 ) .\nthe dark blue region is for the case of small - scale experiments , while the somewhat lighter blue and light blue regions corresponds to the case of the array of telescopes and of the satellite mission respectively .\nthe minimal detectable value of @xmath2 with at least @xmath112 is the one derived from a pure pseudospectrum reconstruction of the angular power spectra of the @xmath0-mode and using the entire set of angular scales ( the _ case a _ of tab . [\ntab : snr ] ) .\nthis shows that a measurement of @xmath2 from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 reconstruction of the @xmath0-mode thanks to datasets coming from a small - scale experiment , is impossible if small fields models appear to be realized in the early universe . though a detection is possible in the large field models , there is still a range of such models for which the level of primordial gravity waves is still undetectable by a small - scale experiment .\nsmall fields models are only marginally accessible from the pure pseudo-@xmath100 estimation of the @xmath0-mode using datasets from an array of telescopes , as @xmath221 is accessible for @xmath213 smaller than @xmath222 .\na detection of @xmath2 consistent with zero with a @xmath112 confidence level implies an excursion of the scalar field ( in planck units ) smaller than 0.8 to 1.8 for @xmath213 varying from 30 to 70 .\nfinally , datasets coming from a satellite mission allows for a detection of primordial gravity waves in the small fields models with the pure pseudospectrum estimation of @xmath67 , providing that the number of e - folds is smaller than @xmath223 . on the range of e - folds considered here ,\na measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio consistent with zero then implies @xmath224 , meaning that a discrimination between large fields models and small fields models is possible for a wide range of values of @xmath213 .\nthis research used resources of the national energy research scientific computing center , which is supported by the office of science of the u.s .\ndepartment of energy under contract no .\nde - ac02 - 05ch11231 .\nsome of the results in this paper have been derived using s@xmath75hat @xcite , healpix  @xcite and class  @xcite software packages .\n999 u. seljak & m. zaldarriaga ,  * 78 * 2054 ( 1997 ) d. n. spergel & m. zaldarriaga ,  * 79 * 2180 ( 1997 ) collaboration : p. a. r. ade , n. aghanim _ et al .\n_ , arxiv:1502.0211 [ astro-ph.co ] ;
