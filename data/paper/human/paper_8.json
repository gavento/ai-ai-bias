    "abstract": " the origin and chemical composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays is still an open question in astroparticle physics . \n the observed large - scale isotropy and also direct composition measurements can be interpreted as an extragalactic proton dominance above the _ ankle _ at about @xmath0 gev . \n photopion production of extragalactic protons in the cosmic microwave background predicts a cutoff at about @xmath1 gev in conflict with excesses reported by some experiments . in this report \n we will outline a recent statistical analysis  @xcite of cosmic ray data using strongly interacting neutrinos as primaries for these excesses .

    "article": "there are reasons to believe that cosmic rays ( crs ) around the ankle at @xmath0 gev are dominated by extragalactic protons  @xcite .\nscattering processes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) limit the propagation of ultra high energy ( uhe ) charged particles in our universe .\na continuation of a power - like cr spectrum above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite at about @xmath1 gev is only consistent with the proton dominance if the sources lie within the proton attenuation length of about 50 mpc .\nvery few astrophysical accelerators can generate crs with energies above the gzk cutoff  ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) and so far none of the candidate sources have been confirmed in our local environment .\nit has been speculated that decaying superheavy particles , possibly some new form of dark matter or remnants of topological defects , could be a source of uhe crs , but also these proposals are not fully consistent with the cr spectrum at lower energies  @xcite .\nthe observation of gzk excesses has led to speculations about a different origin of uhe crs .\nberezinsky and zatsepin  @xcite proposed that _\ncosmogenic _ neutrinos produced in the decay of the gzk photopions could explain these events assuming a strong neutrino nucleon interaction .\nwe have followed this idea in ref .\n@xcite and investigated the statistical goodness of scenarios with strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources using cr data from agasa  @xcite and hires  @xcite ( see fig .  [ cr ] ) and limits from horizontal events at agasa  @xcite and contained events at rice  @xcite .\n-branes , and string excitations ( see ref .\n@xcite ) . ]\nthe flux of uhe extragalactic protons from distant sources is redshifted and also subject to @xmath2 pair production and photopion - production in the cmb which can be taken into account by means of propagation functions .\nthe resonantly produced photopions provide a _ guaranteed _ source of cosmogenic uhe neutrinos observed at earth . in astrophysical accelerators inelastic scattering of the beam protons off the ambient photon gas in the source will also produce photopions which provide an additional source of uhe neutrinos . the corresponding spectrum will in general depend on the details of the source such as the densities of the target photons and the ambient gas  @xcite .\nwe have used the flux of crs from _ optically thin _ sources using the luminosities given in ref .\n@xcite in the goodness - of - fit test .    for a reasonable and consistent contribution of extragalactic neutrinos in vertical crs\none has to assume a strong and rapid enhancement of the neutrino nucleon interaction .\nthe realization of such a behavior has been proposed in scenarios beyond the ( perturbative ) sm ( see ref .\n@xcite ) . for convenience\n, we have approximated the strong neutrino nucleon cross section in our analysis by a @xmath3-behavior shown in fig .\n[ fig ] , parameterized by the energy scale and width of the transition , and the amplification compared to the standard model predictions .\nour analysis showed that uhe crs measured at agasa and hires can be interpreted to the 90% cl as a composition of extragalactic protons and strongly interacting neutrinos from optically thin sources in agreement with experimental results from horizontal events at agasa and contained events at rice ( see fig .\n[ fig ] ) .\nthe pierre auger observatory combines the experimental techniques of agasa and hires as a hybrid detector . with a better energy resolution , much higher statistics and also stronger bounds on horizontal showers\nit will certainly help to clarify our picture of uhe crs in the future .\nthe author would like to thank the organizers of the erice school on nuclear physics 2005 _ `` neutrinos in cosmology , in astro , particle and nuclear physic '' _ for the inspiring workshop and vihkos ( _ `` virtuelles institut fr hochenergiestrahlungen aus dem kosmos '' _ ) for support .\nm.  ahlers , a.  ringwald , and h.  tu , _ astropart .\n( to appear ) , preprint astro - ph/0506698 .\nv.  berezinsky , a.  z.  gazizov and s.  i.  grigorieva , preprint hep - ph/0204357 ; v.  berezinsky , a.  z.  gazizov and s.  i.  grigorieva , .\nm.  ahlers _\net  al . _ , .\nk.  greisen , ; g.  t.  zatsepin and v.  a.  kuzmin , .\nd.  f.  torres and l.  a.  anchordoqui , .\nd.  v.  semikoz and g.  sigl , .\nv.  s.  beresinsky and g.  t.  zatsepin , .\nm.  takeda _\net  al . _ [ agasa ] , .\nd.  j.  bird _\net  al . _\n[ hires ] , ; r.  u.  abbasi _ et  al . _ [ hires ] , ; r.  u.  abbasi _ et  al . _ [ hires ] , . s.  yoshida _\n_ [ agasa ] , .",
