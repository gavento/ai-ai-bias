    "abstract": " we study the thermodynamics of small black holes in compactified spacetimes of the form @xmath0 . \n this system is analyzed with the aid of an effective field theory ( eft ) formalism in which the structure of the black hole is encoded in the coefficients of operators in an effective worldline lagrangian . in this effective theory \n , there is a small parameter @xmath1 that characterizes the corrections to the thermodynamics due to both the non - linear nature of the gravitational action as well as effects arising from the finite size of the black hole . using the power counting of the eft \n we show that the series expansion for the thermodynamic variables contains terms that are analytic in @xmath1 , as well as certain fractional powers that can be attributed to finite size operators . \n in particular our operator analysis shows that existing analytical results do not probe effects coming from horizon deformation . as an example \n , we work out the order @xmath2 corrections to the thermodynamics of small black holes for arbitrary @xmath3 , generalizing the results in the literature .

    "article": "general relativity in spacetime dimension @xmath3 larger than four supports black brane solutions that , unlike in lower dimensions , are not uniquely characterized by their asymptotic charges ( mass , spin , gauge charges ) .\nan example of this situation is the kaluza - klein black hole , a solution of the einstein equations consisting of a black hole embedded in a compactified spacetime , for instance @xmath4 . because of the lack of uniqueness in @xmath5 , this system exhibits a range of phases , characterized by the horizon topology , as the period @xmath6 of the @xmath7 is varied . for @xmath6\nmuch larger than the horizon length scale , the horizon topology is @xmath8 corresponding to an isolated black hole . as @xmath6 becomes of order @xmath9 one finds uniform and non - uniform black string phases with horizon topology @xmath10 .\nthere is evidence to support the conjecture that uniform string decays  @xcite proceed via a topology changing phase transition into a black hole final state ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .\nother proposals for the final state of the unstable black string can be found in  @xcite .\nunderstanding the dynamics of the black hole / black string phase transition is important for a variety of reasons .\napart from being a toy model for studying the physics of topology change in higher dimensional general relativity , it is also relevant for its connection to gauge / gravity duality in string theory  @xcite .\nalso , the kaluza - klein black hole plays a role in the phenomenology of scenarios where gravity is strong at the tev scale , and production of higher dimensional black holes at the lhc becomes a possibility\n.    there does not exist an analytic solution of the einstein equations describing a black hole in the background @xmath0 with @xmath11 ( however , see  @xcite ; for @xmath12 , a closed form metric can be found in ref .\n@xcite ) . for generic values of the ratio @xmath13 one must resort to numerical simulations in order to find solutions .\nthese have been carried out in  @xcite . here\n, we will consider the asymptotic region of the phase diagram in which the parameter @xmath14 is much less than unity , and analytic solutions can be found perturbatively .\nalthough this region of parameter space is likely to be far from where the black hole / black string transition is expected to take place , it is a region that can be mapped out analytically .\nthese perturbative calculations provide a useful test of the numerical simulations , and by extrapolation , may give qualitative information on the full phase diagram of solutions .\nthe @xmath1 corrections to the thermodynamics of a small black hole in the background @xmath4 have been calculated in ref .\n@xcite to leading order for arbitrary @xmath3 , and in ref .\n@xcite to order @xmath2 for @xmath15 . in ref .\n@xcite , the order @xmath1 corrections were calculated by employing a specialized coordinate system  @xcite for the entire spacetime .\nalternatively , the approach taken in  @xcite is to split the spacetime into a region near the black hole where the solution is the @xmath3-schwarzschild metric , @xmath16 weakly perturbed by compactification , and a far region in which the metric can be parametrized in terms of asymptotic multipole moments ( see ref .\n@xcite for a systematic discussion of this procedure ) .\nthese two solutions are then patched together in an overlap region , yielding a relation between the short distance parameters ( the scale @xmath9 of the @xmath3-dimensional schwarzschild metric ) and the mass @xmath17 and tension @xmath18 as measured by an observer far from the black hole .\nthis behavior can be traced to the short distance singularities of the @xmath3-dimensional flat space green s function .\na prescription for handling such divergences at leading order in @xmath1 can be found in  @xcite . ] . as discussed in  @xcite ,\nall thermodynamic quantities relevant to the phase diagram can be calculated given the asymptotic  charges \" @xmath19 .    here\n, we propose a different method for calculating the phase diagram in the perturbative region @xmath20 , based on the effective field theory approach applied to extended gravitational systems developed in  @xcite .\nsince in the @xmath20 limit there is a large hierarchy between the short distance scale @xmath9 and the compactification size , it is natural to integrate out ultraviolet modes at distances shorter than @xmath9 to obtain an effective lagrangian describing the dynamics of the relevant degrees of freedom at the scale @xmath6 . in the resulting eft , the scale @xmath9 only appears in the wilson coefficients of operators in the action constructed from the relevant modes . ignoring horizon absorption  @xcite and spin  @xcite ,\nthese long wavelength modes are simply the metric tensor @xmath21 coupled to the black hole worldline coordinate @xmath22 .\nthe couplings of the particle worldline to the metric can be obtained by a fairly straightforward matching calculation , although one expects that all operators consistent with symmetries ( diffeomorphism invariance , worldline reparametrizations ) are present .\nalthough clearly there are some similarities between the eft approach and the matched asymptotics of  @xcite , there are several advantages to formulating the @xmath1 expansion in the language of an eft :    * in the eft , it is possible to disentangle the terms in the perturbative expansion that arise from the finite extent of the black hole , which scale like integer powers of @xmath13 , versus  post - newtonian \" corrections due to the non - linear terms in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian that scale like integer powers of @xmath23 and are therefore also equivalent to powers of @xmath1 . *\nthe eft has manifest power counting in @xmath1 .\nthis means that it is possible to determine at what order in the expansion effects from the finite size of the black hole horizon first arise . as we will show in the next section , the first finite size correction , which in the eft manifests itself through a non - minimal coupling of the black hole worldline to the riemann tensor arises at order @xmath24 . for a fixed @xmath3 the finite size effects , for example the tidal distortion of the black hole horizon , will contribute to the thermodynamic variables at order @xmath25 relative to the leading order result .\nthus the finite horizon effects become as large as @xmath2 as @xmath26 .\nthis also indicates that the results of refs .\n@xcite are not sensitive to the specific structure of the kaluza - klein black hole , but rather reflect the thermodynamics of structureless point particles .\n* in the eft , calculations can be carried out using the standard tools of field theoretic perturbation theory . in particular\n, the perturbative expansion has a diagrammatic interpretation in terms of standard feynman diagrams .\nultraviolet divergences that arise in feynman integrals can be dealt with using a standard regulator ( e.g , dimensional regularization ) and absorbed into the coefficients of local operators .\nthere is no impediment to renormalizing the theory to all orders in @xmath1 .\nas an example of this procedure we calculate in sec .\n[ sec : pt ] the @xmath27 corrections to the asymptotic mass and tension of the kaluza - klein black hole .\nour results are organized as follows . in sec .\n[ sec : eft ] we formulate the eft and derive the power counting rules for @xmath20 . using this power counting\nwe analyze the relative contribution of an arbitrary finite size worldline operator . in sec .\n[ sec : pt ] we use the eft to calculate the @xmath27 corrections to the asymptotic charges @xmath17 and @xmath18 for arbitrary @xmath3 and use these results in sec .  [ sec : thermo ] to work out the corresponding corrections to the thermodynamic relations . in this section\nwe also compare our analytic formulas to the results of numerical simulations  @xcite for @xmath15 and @xmath28 .\nwe consider an isolated black hole in a background spacetime of the form @xmath0\n. coordinates on @xmath29 are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 labels circumference along @xmath7 . coordinates on @xmath3-dimensional spacetime\nare denoted @xmath32 .\nthe period of the @xmath7 factor as measured by an observer at @xmath33 is @xmath6 .    in order to determine the phase diagram of this system , it is sufficient to calculate the moments of the kaluza - klein black hole that appear in the first non - trivial corrections to the asymptotic metric . by the symmetries of the background , the non - vanishing terms are , to leading order as @xmath34 , @xmath35\nthe coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 are related to the asymptotic mass @xmath17 and tension @xmath18 by the relations  @xcite , @xmath38 the constant @xmath39 is defined such that the newton potential between two masses in uncompactified @xmath3-dimensional space is @xmath40 .    in the limit @xmath41 , these quantities can be calculated in perturbation theory .\none method is to solve the einstein equations perturbatively , using the matched asymptotic techniques of  @xcite .\nanother possibility is to first integrate out the black hole , replacing the spacetime in the vicinity of the horizon with an effective lagrangian for the black hole worldline coupled to gravity .\nincluding all terms with up to two derivatives ( we will be more specific about the expansion parameter in this expansion below ) this lagrangian takes the form @xmath42 -m_0\\int ds + c_e\\int ds   e_{\\alpha\\beta } e^{\\alpha\\beta } + c_b\\int ds b_{\\alpha_1\\cdots\\alpha_{d-2 } } b^{\\alpha_1\\cdots\\alpha_{d-2 } } + \\cdots.\\ ] ] here , as in any other eft , we have simply written down all terms compatible with diffeomorphism invariance and worldline reparametrization invariance . in this equation ,\n@xmath43 and the tensors @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the electric and magnetic components of the riemann tensor . @xmath46 note that if the black hole is in a ricci flat background then operators involving the ricci tensor can be removed by field redefinitions of the metric . in this case\nthe components of @xmath47 are sufficient to specify the riemann tensor .\nall coefficients of operators in eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) scale like powers of @xmath48 and @xmath9 , given by @xmath49 in a way that we can be fixed by matching to the full schwarzschild solution ( see below ) .    starting from eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) , we use the background field method  @xcite to calculate @xmath17 and @xmath18 .\nwe decompose the metric tensor into a long wavelength non - dynamical background field @xmath50 and a short wavelength graviton field @xmath51 @xmath52 and do the path integral over @xmath53 , holding the black hole worldline to some fixed value @xmath22 , @xmath54 = \\int { \\cal d } h_{\\alpha\\beta }   \\exp i \\left(s[{\\bar g}+h , x ] + s_{gf}[{\\bar g},h]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a suitable gauge fixing term .\nit is convenient to choose @xmath55 to be compatible with background field diffeomorphisms , for example @xmath56 with @xmath57 .    to calculate eq .\n( [ eq : pi ] ) it is sufficient to linearize about flat space , @xmath58 and to take @xmath59 .\nthe relation between @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be read off the linear terms in @xmath62 $ ] with no derivatives @xmath63 = -{1\\over 2 } m\\int dt { \\bar h}_{00 } + { 1\\over 2 } \\tau l\\int dt { \\bar h}_{zz } + \\cdots.\\ ] ] because of eq .\n( [ eq : pi ] ) , these two terms are simply the sum of feynman diagrams like those of fig .\n[ eb ] , fig .\n[ m2 ] and fig .\nwavy internal lines denote the propagator for the graviton @xmath53 , which given our form for @xmath55 is @xmath64 with @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath66 is the kaluza - klein representation of the propagator on flat @xmath0 .\nthe solid lines denote the black hole worldline .\nthere are no propagators associated with such lines .\nan external line denotes an insertion of a factor of @xmath67 .\nfinally , the vertices are constructed from the @xmath68-graviton terms in the expansion of eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) about flat space .\ndiagrams that become disconnected by the removal of the particle worldline do not contribute to the terms in @xmath62 $ ] .\nnote also that if we treat eq .\n( [ eq : tad ] ) as an effective source term in the einstein equations , we recover the relation eq .\n( [ eq : ab ] ) between the metric coefficients @xmath69 and the thermodynamic charges .\neach feynman diagram in the eft contributes a definite power of @xmath1 to the terms in eq .\n( [ eq : tad ] ) .\ncounting powers of @xmath1 is straightforward . given that the only scale in the propagator is @xmath6 we assign @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 so that we assign the scaling @xmath72 .\nwe assign no power counting factors to @xmath67 .\npower counting relative to the action for the free background graviton , the parameter @xmath73 that counts graviton loops is @xmath74 this means that @xmath75 and for example the terms @xmath76 obtained by expanding eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) , scale as @xmath77 .\ntherefore the diagram in fig .\n[ m2](b ) gives a contribution to @xmath62 $ ] that scales like ( @xmath78 denotes a time ordered vev in the free graviton theory ) , @xmath79 so that by eq .  ( [ eq : lo ] ) it gives a contribution to @xmath17 that is suppressed by a single power of @xmath1 relative to the leading order result @xmath80 .\nlikewise , the @xmath81 vertex in the gravitational action is @xmath82 so that fig .\n[ m2](a ) scales like @xmath83 . in general , a given diagram scales as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the latter bound saturated by diagrams containing no internal graviton loops .    in order to power\ncount the worldline operators with more derivatives , we first need to fix the dependence of the coefficients on @xmath48 and @xmath9 .\nthis is done by matching the effective lagrangian of eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) to the full black hole theory , described by the schwarzschild metric of eq .\n( [ eq : bhmetric ] ) . as in any other eft ,\nthe matching procedure consists of adjusting the couplings in the effective lagrangian so that observables calculated in the eft agree with those of the full theory .\na convenient observable to match to is the @xmath87-matrix element for low energy elastic graviton scattering off the black hole geometry . in the full theory\n, this is obtained by solving the linearized wave equation for the graviton field in the schwarzschild metric .\nafter separation of variables this boils down to solving a radial equation that generalizes the regge - wheeler equation describing perturbations of four - dimensional schwarzschild black holes to @xmath3-dimensions .\nthe explicit form of this equation can be found in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .\nsince the only scale in the full theory is @xmath9 we expect the amplitude to take the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the energy of the incident graviton , @xmath90 are spin labels , @xmath91 is the scattering angle and @xmath92 is a calculable function .        in the eft\n, the scattering cross section receives contributions from insertions of all the couplings in eq .\n( [ eq : efts ] ) . in particular , the two - derivative operators give rise to terms in the amplitude that go like @xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are functions whose specific form is not important for our purposes here .\nthus @xmath95 are non - zero only if @xmath92 has a term in the low energy limit that scales like @xmath96 . if this is the case then we find that @xmath97 . after expanding about flat space\n, we have for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 the first contribution to the tadpoles in @xmath62 $ ] due to an insertion of @xmath101 is from the diagram in fig .\n[ eb ] . according to our power counting rules\n@xmath102 implying that the @xmath20 thermodynamics is not sensitive to the structure of the black hole until order @xmath103 , which for @xmath15 is one order beyond the second order results of  @xcite and becomes @xmath27 as @xmath26 . more generally , a worldline operator with @xmath104 derivatives and @xmath105 factors of the graviton scales like @xmath106 and it gives a contribution to the charges @xmath17 and @xmath18 that is order @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .\nas an application of the eft method , we now compute the @xmath27 corrections to the quantities @xmath60 that govern the thermodynamics of the kaluza - klein black hole . according to the power counting rules established in the previous section , the relevant diagrams are those of fig .\n[ m2 ] and fig .\nfinite size effects do not come in at this order .\nthe first corrections to the mass and tension of the system arise from the two diagrams in fig .\nthe diagram in fig .\n[ m2](a ) gives a contribution to the background field effective action which , using the feynman rules of the eft , is of the form @xmath109 ^ 2 v_{k_\\perp n}({\\bar h}),\\ ] ] where the vertex function is @xmath110 { \\bar h}_{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] since we are only interested in the terms of eq .\n( [ eq : tad ] ) we have set @xmath111 to a constant , in which case the momentum flowing into the diagram vanishes and the calculation of the integral simplifies . for the @xmath112 term , eq .\n( [ eq : v ] ) gives @xmath113 where we have used @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the riemann zeta function .\nnote that this integral is actually ultraviolet divergent .\nthe divergence renormalizes the point particle mass and can be absorbed by a shift in @xmath116 .\nwe use dimensional regularization to deal with this .\nsince we are interested in @xmath11 , the divergent part of the integral is simply set to zero by the regulator .\nfor the @xmath117 term we have @xmath118 here we have used the additional integral @xmath119 ^ 2 = \\left(2-{d\\over 2}\\right ) i_0(l).\\ ] ]    since the source is at rest , fig .\n[ m2](b ) only gives a contribution to the @xmath112 tadpole @xmath120 combining these results we find to first order in @xmath1 @xmath121 where we have defined @xmath122 .\nthis reproduces the results of  @xcite .\nit is convenient to consider separately the corrections to the @xmath123 , @xmath124 terms in the effective action . for the @xmath124 terms , the diagrams in fig .\n[ m3](a ) , fig .\n[ m3](c ) , and fig .\n[ m3](e ) do not contribute .\nit is straightforward to derive the feynman rules necessary to calculate the diagrams of fig .\nwe will simply write down the results of evaluating each diagram . for the @xmath123 tadpoles in the effective action\n, one finds that evaluating the diagrams at zero external momentum gives rise to no new integrals : the integration over the internal momenta factorizes into the square of the integrals @xmath125 of the previous section .\nthe results are @xmath126 for the tadpole terms @xmath124 , we find from fig .\n[ m3](b ) @xmath127 the contribution of graphs fig .\n[ m3](d ) , fig .\n[ m3](f ) to the tadpole @xmath123 does not factorize into the integrals of the form @xmath125 .\nhowever their sum does , @xmath128 thus the @xmath129 terms in the effective action are @xmath130\\right|_{\\ell\\lambda^2 } = -{1\\over 4}m_0{\\hat\\lambda}^2 \\int dt { \\bar h}_{00 } -{1\\over 2 } m_0 ( d-3 ) { \\hat\\lambda}^2 \\int dt { \\bar h}_{zz}.\\ ] ]\nwe have found , from the diagrams in fig .  [ m2 ] and fig .\n[ m3 ] @xmath131 to obtain observables which can be tested against the numerical data of  @xcite , we must eliminate the unphysical bare mass parameter @xmath116 from these two equations .\nthis gives , @xmath132 which agrees with the results of  @xcite when @xmath15 .\nwe may then relate the asymptotic charge to the thermodynamics quantities via smarr s relation @xmath133 ( see ref .\n@xcite ) which , using eq .\n( [ eq : tvm ] ) , gives @xmath134 as a function of @xmath135 .\nas @xmath136 the entropy @xmath87 simply becomes the entropy of an isolated @xmath3-dimensional black hole .\nthis scales like the area of the black hole , @xmath137 .\nthus for @xmath20 we expect @xmath138 the function @xmath139 can be obtained from the relation @xmath140 together with the formula for @xmath134 that follows from smarr s law .\nwe finds @xmath141 and @xmath142\\zeta^2(d-3 ) \\left({2\ng_n m\\over l^{d-3}}\\right)^2+\\cdots,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the entropy and temperature of an uncompactified black hole , @xmath145    we may then compare with the numerical results of kudoh and wiseman @xcite in the special cases of five and six dimensions which are shown in fig .  [\nfig : data](a ) and fig .\n[ fig : data](b ) respectively in units where the entropy of the uncompactified @xmath3-dimensional black hole is @xmath146 . ] .\nthe difference between the numerical data and the analytical results grows with @xmath87 , but it is difficult to gauge the relevance of this deviation without some measure of the errors in the numerical computation . as a crude measure of convergence of the perturbative expansion we plot in fig .\n[ fig : conv ] the ratio of the @xmath27 to the @xmath147 terms in the series expansion for @xmath148 versus @xmath87 .     to @xmath147 terms in the perturbative expansion of @xmath149 versus @xmath87 for @xmath15 ( dashed line ) and @xmath28 ( solid line).,width=302 ]\nin this paper , we have used eft methods to determine the qualitative structure of the thermodynamics of kaluza - klein black holes when their radius is much smaller than the compactification scale . using the power counting in the eft , we find that the asymptotic charges @xmath19 are related in the regime @xmath150 by an expansion of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is analytic about zero and @xmath153 . for @xmath154 ,\nwe find @xmath155,\\ ] ] which agrees with the @xmath156 results of  @xcite in @xmath3 spacetime dimensions and with the @xmath157 @xmath15 results of  @xcite calculated in perturbation theory about the full uncompactifed schwarzschild background .\nthus our results indicate that the existing analytical tests of the numerics for @xmath158 only probe the thermodynamics of point particles and are not sensitive to the dynamics of the black hole horizon\n. it would be interesting to repeat the numerical simulations for large dimension where the phase diagram is more sensitive to the structure of the horizon .\nfor instance in @xmath159 , the first finite size effect comes in at order @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and is distinguishable from terms in the black hole thermodynamics that can be reproduced by a minimal point particle action @xmath162 .\n+   +      we thank h. kudoh and t. wiseman for making the numerical results of  @xcite available to us , and t. wiseman for helpful discussions .\ny -
