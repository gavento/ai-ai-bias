    "abstract": " we present a new assessment of the ability of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) to form massive stars and clusters . \n this is done by comparison with an empirical mass - size threshold for massive star formation ( msf ) . \n we establish @xmath0 as a novel approximate msf limit , based on clouds with and without msf . \n many irdcs , if not most , fall short of this threshold . without significant evolution , \n such clouds are unlikely msf candidates . \n this provides a first quantitative assessment of the small number of irdcs evolving towards msf . \n irdcs below this limit might still form stars and clusters of up to intermediate mass , though ( like , e.g. , the ophiuchus and perseus molecular clouds ) . \n nevertheless , a major fraction of the mass contained in irdcs might reside in few @xmath1 clouds sustaining msf .

    "article": "about a decade ago , galactic plane surveys revealed large numbers of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs , @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nthese are identified as dark patches against the diffuse galactic mid - infrared background .\nfirst studies of very opaque irdcs suggested that these have very high densities , column densities , and masses ( @xmath2\\gtrsim{}10 ^ 5~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ ] , @xmath3\\gtrsim{}10^{23}~\\rm{}cm^{-2}$ ] , @xmath4 ; @xcite ) . since they are dark , they are likely to be in an early evolutionary phase . embedded in irdcs are `` cores '' of a few dozen solar masses @xcite .\nit has therefore been suggested that many irdcs are the long - sought examples of clouds just at the onset of the formation of massive stars and ( proto-)clusters .\nthis notion was corroborated by observations of young massive stars in a few individual irdcs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nsuch views also form the framework of schemes for irdc evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and reviews ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .\nirdc samples are usually compared to regions of massive star formation ( msf ) , such as orion and m17 ( e.g. , @xcite).[sec : introduction ]    this picture can not be complete , though .\nthe above studies ( and @xcite ) acknowledge that regions forming low and intermediate mass stars can also appear as shadows in images at mid - infrared wavelength @xcite .\nsuch irdcs will not form massive stars .\nunfortunately , the number of irdcs evolving towards msf is presently not known .\nfractions up to 100% have been considered in the past ( section [ sec : most - stars - irdc ] ) .    in this letter\n, we thus use a novel criterion to provide the first conclusive quantitative demonstration that only few irdcs are headed towards msf .\nthis aids identifying pre - msf irdcs as targets for alma and herschel . as a bonus ,\nthe msf threshold identified below  the first observational limit of this kind \ninforms theory .    in papers\ni and ii @xcite , we show that solar neighborhood clouds devoid of msf ( specifically : perseus , ophiuchus , taurus , and pipe nebula ) generally obey @xmath5 irdcs submitting to eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) would resemble , e.g. , ophiuchus and perseus , but not orion ( which violates eq.[eq : mass - size - limit ] ) .\nfigure [ fig : msf - limit ] illustrates why clouds bound for msf must exceed eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . since star formation necessitates an appropriate mass reservoir , msf requires that a large mass is concentrated in a relatively small volume . based on more detailed theoretical considerations , section [ sec : msf - limits ]\nputs quantitative limits on this intuitively evident reasoning . as seen in fig .\n[ fig : msf - limit ] , the masses in this msf region are well above the mass  size range bound by eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . observations of msf clouds confirm eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) as a true msf limit ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) .\nthis suggests to use eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) to roughly separate irdcs with ( future ) msf from those without .\nthis letter is organized as follows .\nbased on data from section [ sec : method ] , section [ sec : msf - threshold ] confirms ( using known msf clouds ) that eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) approximates an msf limit .\nmany well - studied irdcs ( 25%50% ) fall short of this threshold ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) .\nless certain data for complete irdc samples suggests that most irdcs obey eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) , and will thus not form massive stars ( section [ sec : typical - irdcs ] ) .\nstill , most of the mass contained by irdcs might be in clouds forming massive stars ( i.e. , those violating eq .\n[ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) .    ; _ green and blue shading _ ) in relation to mass - size laws ( e.g. , @xmath6=m_0\\cdot{}r^b$ ] ) observed for non - msf clouds ( eq .

@xcite map water masers embedded in cs clumps of high bolometric luminosity ( @xmath10 ) ; @xcite explore methanol masers and ultra - compact hii regions ; @xcite study the nearby cygnus - x msf site ( we use their ` clumps ' ) . to exclude fragments\nnot forming massive stars , we only use the ` type 1 ' sources ( @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 emission , no resolved radio continuum ) from the @xcite survey , and ignore the secondary ` mm - only ' cores ( without masers and hii regions ) in the @xcite study .\nthe irdc samples were created using msx and spitzer images .\n@xcite ( @xcite ; using bolometers ) and @xcite ( @xcite ; using @xmath13 extinction ) focus on clouds with stark @xmath13 contrast .\n@xcite report @xmath14-based results for all irdcs evident in their @xmath14 galactic plane survey .\n@xcite catalogue extinction properties for @xmath15 spitzer @xmath13 irdcs with unknown distances .\nthe mass - size data for solar neighborhood clouds are derived in paper ii ( using methods summarized in section 2.1 and fig .  1 of paper i ) .\nthey are based on column density maps derived from dust emission ( mambo and bolocam ) and extinction ( 2mass ) data . using a dendogram method introduced by @xcite ,\nstarting from a set of local column density maxima , a given column density map is contoured with infinitesimal level spacing .\nevery contour defines the boundary of a cloud fragment .\nwe derive the contour - enclosed mass and the effective radius , @xmath16 .\nsubsequent contours / fragments are usually nested .\nthis defines relationships between cloud fragments , essentially yielding series of mass - size measurements . in fig .\n[ fig : mass - size - comparison ] , such series are drawn using continuous lines .    to derive column densities from the extinction maps ,\nwe assume that column density and visual extinction are related by @xmath17 @xcite . to combine dust emission and extinction observations ,\nthey must be calibrated with respect to one another . in practice ,\nwe use @xcite dust opacities ( decreased by a factor 1.5 , to match observed opacity laws ; section 4.2 of paper i ) for emission - based masses .    for comparisons\n, we must scale all masses to the column density laws from paper ii . also , it is necessary to harmonize the different definitions of mass and size .\nthe scaled data are shown in fig.[fig : mass - size - comparison ] .\nwhere relevant , we use dust temperatures suggested by the original studies . however , we substitute our choice of dust opacities and the aforementioned 1.5 scaling factor .\n@xmath14 masses are directly taken from @xcite , since their @xmath14-to - mass conversion law is in rough agreement with ( i.e. , by factors of 1.12.0 larger than ) the extinction - calibrated ones derived by @xcite .\nwe assume that dust emission at @xmath18 wavelength and optical depth at @xmath19 wavelength are related by @xmath20 ( eq .  4 of @xcite ) , and derive column densities from these intensities ( assuming dust at @xmath21 , and using the 1.5 scaling factor ) .\nwe thus increase the @xcite masses ( from their case ` a ' ) by a factor 1.47 ( to account for their choice of opacities and molecular weights)^2/    1\\farcs2 ^ 2)$ ] , where @xmath22 is distance , since pixels per beam ( as erroneously adopted ) have to be replaced by pixels per clump in eq .\n( 5 ) of @xcite . ] .    in many cases ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ,\nthe size listed in the original publication refers to the contour at half peak intensity , while the mass measurement includes emission at much lower levels . in these cases , we assume that the sources have a near - gaussian shape ( just as explicitly assumed in many of the original papers ) . for such sources ,\nthe mass contained in the half peak column density contour is just a fraction @xmath23 of the total mass ( eq .  a.23 of @xcite ; the area at half peak intensity is @xmath24 ^ 2 $ ] ) .\nthus we reduce the mass to a fraction @xmath25 , and use half of the published fwhm size as the effective radius .\n@xcite list masses for a sphere , not an aperture , and so the mass ( taken for the smaller of their radii ) has to be scaled up by a factor of order @xmath26 ( @xcite , eq.13 ) . if more than one distance is listed for a given object , we adopt the smaller one ( yielding a lower limit to @xmath6/m_{\\rm{}lim}[r]$ ] derived below ) .\nlc ) approximates a mass - size limit for msf ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) .\nonly a fraction of the irdcs exceed this msf limit ( fig .\n[ fig : compactness ] , section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . if a star - forming region contains more than one fragment ( i.e. , clump , core , etc . ) , the most compact fragment ( i.e. , with maximum @xmath6/m_{\\rm{}lim}[r]$ ] ) is highlighted by a circle.[fig : mass - size - comparison],title=\"fig : \" ] &     + ) approximates a mass - size limit for msf ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) .\nonly a fraction of the irdcs exceed this msf limit ( fig .\n[ fig : compactness ] , section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . if a star - forming region contains more than one fragment ( i.e. , clump , core , etc . )\n, the most compact fragment ( i.e. , with maximum @xmath6/m_{\\rm{}lim}[r]$ ] ) is highlighted by a circle.[fig : mass - size - comparison],title=\"fig : \" ] &     + ) approximates a mass - size limit for msf ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) .\nonly a fraction of the irdcs exceed this msf limit ( fig .\n[ fig : compactness ] , section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) . if a star - forming region contains more than one fragment ( i.e. , clump , core , etc . )\n, the most compact fragment ( i.e. , with maximum @xmath6/m_{\\rm{}lim}[r]$ ] ) is highlighted by a circle.[fig : mass - size - comparison],title=\"fig : \" ] &\nat given radius , a cloud fragment ( i.e. , clump , core , etc . ) can be compared against eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) by deriving the mass ratio @xmath27 ( where @xmath28=870\\,m_{\\sun}\\,[r/{\\rm{}pc}]^{1.33}$ ] ) , to which we refer as the ` compactness ' .\n`` secondary cores '' ( only listed by @xcite and @xcite ) are suppressed by characterizing star - forming regions ( i.e. , a given massive star , or an entire irdc ) by their most compact fragment , @xmath29 $ ] .\n$ ] , for various cloud samples . for a given sample , the ratios below which a certain fraction ( e.g. , 25% ) of the sample members resides are indicated by bars . local non - msf clouds ( fig .\n[ fig : mass - size - comparison][a ] ) have a compactness @xmath30 ( eq .

[\nfig : compactness ] that regions forming massive stars are , at given radius , more massive than the limiting mass , @xmath31 . in all surveys of msf regions , @xmath32 of the clouds\nhave a maximum compactness @xmath33 .\none survey @xcite contains a very small number of regions ( @xmath34 ) less compact than required by eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) .\nthese regions might be interesting targets for follow - up studies .\nin general , though , this analysis corroborates the hypothesis that eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) approximates a threshold for msf .\nfigure [ fig : compactness ] provides a compactness analysis for irdcs .\nwe separately characterize the @xcite sample including and excluding their ` em ' cores with associated @xmath13 sources ( which are not dark ) .\n`` true '' irdcs will have properties in between these extremes .\ntwo interesting trends manifest in these @xmath27 data .\nfirst , irdcs have masses which are , for given size , comparable to those of solar neighborhood clouds not forming massive stars ( e.g. , ophiuchus and perseus ) . in all samples ,\n@xmath35 of all clouds have a compactness @xmath36 . except for the @xcite clouds ,\n@xmath37 of all targets exceed eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) by a factor @xmath38 .\nsecond , irdcs are less compact than regions forming massive stars .\nfor example , excluding the @xcite targets , @xmath32 of all irdcs are less compact than most ( @xmath32 ) of the msf regions .    in summary , the irdcs studied here have ( for given size ) masses in between those of regions with and without msf ( where `` true '' @xcite irdcs have properties in between the two extremes shown ) .\nvery clearly , they do not reside in the mass - size space unambiguously associated with the formation of massive stars .\nhowever , before drawing final conclusions , let us consider some biases affecting our analysis .\nfirst , @xcite derive masses using clumpfind , while @xcite use gaussclumps . for the former ,\npaper i showed explicitly that the derived masses are , for given radius , just @xmath39 of those derived using our dendrogram approach .\nfor the latter , the same is expected , since the gaussian fits only describe a fraction of the emission .\nin a given map , our characterization scheme from papers i and ii would thus find larger masses .\nthese biases are countered by other factors , though .\nwe use the ` case a ' masses ( assuming bright ir foregrounds ) provided by @xcite .\nfollowing @xcite , their ` case b ' ( fainter foregrounds ) appears to be more realistic .\nthe masses could thus be lower by a factor @xmath40 @xcite .\nsimilarly , @xcite suggests @xmath14-to - mass conversion factors lower than used by @xcite . in any case\n, similar biases affect the data for msf regions .\ndifferences between these and irdcs are not likely to only come from observational uncertainties\n.    finally , none of the irdcs in the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples are `` typical '' for the general galactic population . @xcite and @xcite select clouds which are unusually dark in @xmath19 images .\n@xcite only characterize irdcs which are relatively large and dark , and are clearly detected in @xmath14 emission .\nall this excludes irdcs of low mass and density from the samples .\nless biased irdc samples should thus be less compact than derived here .\nthe @xcite catalogue lists irdc angular sizes and column densities for the entire galactic plane covered by spitzer .\nit thus provides an ideal tool to derive a first idea of typical irdc properties . since they likely constitute ( to our present knowledge ) the typical reservoir of galactic star - forming gas\n, irdc characteristics probably gauge the early state of galactic star forming regions .\n( c ) , but for the @xcite sample ( projected out to various distances).[fig : peretto - fuller ] ]    cccccccccccccc    ' '' ''    distance@xmath41&number@xmath42&fraction@xmath43 & mass@xmath42&mass fraction@xmath43 +    ' '' ''    kpc&&%&@xmath44&% +    ' '' ''    2&831&7&2.0&71 + 4&2218&20&9.8&87 + 6&3639&32&23.6&93 +    ' '' ''    8&4778&42&43.2&96 +    ' '' ''\n@xmath41distance to which the sample is projected    @xmath42number of clouds with @xmath45 , and their total mass    @xmath43mass and number fraction of compact clouds    since no distances are known for the @xcite irdcs , we constrain their masses and sizes assuming a reasonable range of distances .\nanalysis by @xcite and @xcite suggests that most irdcs have distances of @xmath46@xmath47 .\nfigure [ fig : peretto -

integrated column density ) seen in these irdcs , even for small irdc distances .\nunfortunately , the @xcite survey is ( like most extinction studies ) uncertain in the sense that it assumes that the diffuse galactic emission can be reliably modelled in its spatial distribution .\nthis may not be true .\nin this spirit , the results from this section should be taken as an indication , not as a final result .\nconsider the following toy model to understand the expected mass -

[\nfig : msf - limit ] ] and timescales from spitzer observations of solar neighborhood clouds . within the model\n, cloud collapse will only yield a massive star if initiated inside the boundaries set by eqs.([eq : msf - ff][eq : msf - efficiency ] ) . @xcite\nprovide a similar limit , derived assuming that the collapsing region is heated by a cluster of low - mass stars ( in our terminology , they use @xmath65 ) .    in order to sustain msf\n, at least a few cloud fragments in msf clouds must reside within the theoretical msf boundaries mentioned above ( fig .\n[ fig : msf - limit ] ) .\nthe global structure of these clouds can usually be described by power laws , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ( paper ii ) .\nsuch power laws imply that msf clouds violate @xmath68 ( eq .  [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . depending on slope ( @xmath7 ) , intercept ( @xmath8 ) , and their interplay , such excesses are expected for radii @xmath69 ( fig.[fig : msf - limit ] ) .\nthis is just what we find for msf clouds ( fig.[fig : mass - size - comparison][b ] ) .\nmsf is thus only possible if a clouds slopes are shallow , intercepts are large , or both , when compared to eq.([eq : mass - size - limit ] ) .\nthis permits a new way to quantitatively compare the structure of clouds with and without msf .\npure differences in @xmath8 imply that msf and non - msf clouds only differ in their absolute properties .\ndifferences in slopes @xmath7 , however , imply _ relative _ differences in the structure , such as deviations in the hierarchical cloud structure .\nthe irdc properties mentioned in the introduction ( @xmath2\\gtrsim{}10 ^ 5~\\rm{}cm^{-3}$ ] , @xmath3\\gtrsim{}10^{23}~\\rm{}cm^{-2}$ ] , @xmath4 ) only seem to characterize the densest patches in very large and massive irdcs .\nthey are not well suited to describe irdcs on average\n.    some irdcs with @xmath68 might further evolve and eventually undergo msf . and\nparticular dust properties could , in principle , erroneously indicate @xmath68 where the reverse is true .\nhowever , such caveats are not usually considered when using irdc data to constrain msf .\nthus we abstain from such considerations .\nour study suggests that many irdcs , if not most , are not related to msf .\none thus has to be prudent when using irdc properties to constrain msf initial conditions .\nmost studies discussing irdcs as pre - msf sites concentrated on very opaque irdcs of large angular size .\nthese clouds often violate eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) , and many of them are good msf candidates .\n@xcite suggest that most of the galactic star formation might come from irdcs .\nthe absence of other likely reservoirs of star - forming gas evinces this too . by number ,\nmost irdcs are likely to form stars and clusters of low and intermediate mass , just as ophiuchus and perseus do .\nstill , many irdcs will turn towards msf .\ninterestingly , table [ tab : peretto - fuller ] suggests that most of the mass located in irdcs is in clouds that will form massive stars .\nfor example , the 250 most compact clouds from the @xcite sample ( identified assuming a common distance ) contain more than 50% of the area - integrated column density of all irdcs .\nthis suggests that they also contain a major fraction of the mass seen in irdcs .\nif this reasoning is correct , just few @xmath1 irdcs ( and not all @xmath70 : @xcite ) might contain most of the galaxy s star - forming gas . given the uncertain nature of the properties derived from the @xcite data ( section [ sec : typical - irdcs ] )\n, this conclusion is far from certain , though .\nthis letter studies whether infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) are able to form massive stars .\nour main conclusions are as follows .\n* observations of regions with and without massive star formation ( msf ) suggest that the condition @xmath71 ( eq . [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) approximates a threshold for msf ( section [ sec : msf - threshold ] ) .\nmsf clouds differ from those obeying eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) in mass - size slope or intercept ( fig .\n[ fig : msf - limit ] , section [ sec : msf - limits ] ) .\n* many irdcs ( section [ sec : well - studied - irdcs ] ) , if not most ( section [ sec : typical - irdcs ] ) , do not exceed eq .\n( [ eq : mass - size - limit ] ) . without significant further evolution ,\nsuch clouds are unlikely candidates for msf , but they might well form stars and clusters of up to intermediate mass ( like perseus and ophiuchus ) .\nvery opaque irdcs of large angular size constitute good msf candidates . *\nprovided extinction - based masses can be trusted , just few @xmath1 irdcs might contain a major fraction of the galaxy s star - forming gas ( section [ sec : most - stars - irdc ] ) .\nthese irdcs would be dense and massive enough to host msf .\nabergel , a. , bernard , j.  p. , boulanger , f. , cesarsky , c. , desert , f.  x. , falgarone , e. , lagache , g. , perault , m. , puget , j .- l . , reach , w.  t. , nordh , l. , olofsson , g. , huldtgren , m. , kaas , a.  a. , andre , p. , bontemps , s. , burgdorf , m. , copet , e. , davies , j. , montmerle , t. , persi , p. , & sibille , f. 1996 , astronomy and astrophysics                      evans , n.  j. , dunham , m.  m. , j  rgensen , j.  k. , enoch , m.  l. , mern , b. , van dishoeck , e.  f. , alcal , j.  m. , myers , p.  c. , stapelfeldt , k.  r. , huard , t.  l. , allen , l.  e. , harvey , p.  m. , van kempen , t. , blake , g.  a. , koerner , d.  w. , mundy , l.  g. , padgett , d.  l. , & sargent , a.  i. 2009 , , 181 , 321                        perault , m. , omont , a. , simon , g. , seguin , p. , ojha , d. , blommaert , j. , felli , m. , gilmore , g. , guglielmo , f. , habing , h. , price , s. , robin , a. , de  batz , b. , cesarsky , c. , elbaz , d. , epchtein , n. , fouque , p. , guest , s. , levine , d. , pollock , a. , prusti , t. , siebenmorgen , r. , testi , l. , & tiphene , d. 1996 , astronomy and astrophysics",
