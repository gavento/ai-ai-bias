    "abstract": " we review recent progress of understanding and resolving instabilities driven by mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks in 2-flavor color superconductor . with the increase of mismatch , \n the 2sc phase exhibits chromomagnetic instability as well as color neutral baryon current instability . \n we describe the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework , and show that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding pseudo nambu - golstone current . \n the nambu - goldstone currents generation state covers the gluon phase as well as the one - plane wave loff state . \n we further point out that , when charge neutrality condition is required , there exists a narrow unstable loff ( us - loff ) window , where not only off - diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon can not avoid the magnetic instability . in this us - loff window , the diagonal magnetic instability can not be cured by off - diagonal gluon condensate in the color superconducting phase .

loff window , the transverse meissner mass square of 8-th gluon is always zero in the full loff window , which is guaranteed by the momentum equation .    us - loff is a very interesting window , it indicates that the loff state even can not cure the 8-th gluon s magnetic instability . in the charge neutral 2-flavor system\n, it seems that the diagonal gluon s magnetic instability can not be cured in the gluon phase , because there is no direct relation between the diagonal gluon s instability and the off - diagonal gluons instability .\n( of course , it has to be carefully checked , whether all the instabilities in this us - loff window can be cured by off - diagonal gluons condensate in the charge neutral 2-flavor system . )\nit is also noticed that in this us - loff window , the mismatch is close to the diquark gap , i.e. , @xmath134 .\ntherefore it is interesting to check whether this us - loff window can be stabilized by a spin-1 condensate @xcite as proposed in ref .\n@xcite .    in the charge\nneutral 2sc phase , though it is unlikely , we might have a lucky chance to cure the diagonal instability by the condensation of off - diagonal gluons .\nit is expected that this instability will show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluidity system , e.g. , in the fixed number density case @xcite .\nit will be a new challenge for us to really solve this problem .\nwe have seen that , except chromomagnetic instability corresponding to broken generators of @xmath1 , the g2sc phase is also unstable with respect to the external neutral baryon current . it is noticed that all the instabilities are induced by increasing the mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the cooper pairing . in order to understand the instability driven by mismatch , in the following , we give some general analysis .    a superconductor will be eventually destroyed and goes to the normal fermi liquid state , so one natural question is : how an ideal bcs superconductor will be destroyed by increasing mismatch ? to answer how a superconductor will be destroyed , one has to firstly understand what is a superconductor .\nthe superconducting phase is characterized by the order parameter @xmath135 , which is a complex scalar field and has the form of e.g. , for electrical superconductor , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 the amplitude and @xmath138 the phase of the gap order parameter or the pseudo nambu -

bcs like , but berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-like @xcite , even if the amplitude of the order parameter is large and finite , superconductivity will be lost with the destruction of phase coherence , e.g. the phase transition from the @xmath144wave superconductor to the pseudogap state in high temperature superconductors @xcite .\nstimulating by the role of the phase fluctuation in the unconventional superconducting phase in condensed matter , we follow ref .\n@xcite to formulate the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework in order to naturally take into account the contribution from the phase fluctuation or pseudo nambu -

goldstone currents , we will naturally have the nambu - goldstone currents generation in the system with the increase of mismatch , i.e. , @xmath181 and/or @xmath182 at large @xmath183 .\nthis is an extended version of the nambu - goldstone current generation state proposed in a minimal gapless model in ref .\n@xcite . from eq .\n( [ lagr - nl ] ) , we can see that @xmath184 contributes to the baryon current .\n@xmath182 indicates a baryon current generation or 8-th gluon condensate in the system , it is just the one - plane wave loff state .\nthis has been discussed in sec .\n[ sec - usloff ] .\nthe other four nambu - goldstone currents generation @xmath181 indicates other color current generation in the system , and is equivalent to the gluon phase described in ref .\n@xcite .\nwe do not argue whether the system will exprience a gluon condensate phase or nambu - goldstone currents generation state .\nwe simply think they are equivalent .\nin fact , the gauge fields and the nambu - goldstone currents share a gauge covariant form as shown in the free propogator . however , we prefer to using nambu - goldstone currents generation than the gluon condensate in the gnjl model . as mentioned in sec .\n[ sec - gnjl ] , in the gnjl model , all the information from unkown nonperturbative gluons are hidden in the diquark gap parameter @xmath185 .\nthe gauge fields in the lagrangian density are just external fields , they only play the role of probing the system , but do not contribute to the property of the color superconducting phase . therefore , there is no gluon free - energy in the gnjl model , it is not clear how to derive the gluon condensate in this model . in order to investigate the problem in a fully self - consistent way\n, one has to use the ambitious framework by using the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite including diquark degree of freedom @xcite or in the framework of effective theory of high - density quark matter as in ref .\n@xcite .        except the chromomagnetic instability\n, the g2sc phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to the perturbation of an external baryon current .\nthis suggests a baryon current can be spontaneously generated in the g2sc phase , and the quasiparticles spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity .\nthe spontaneously generated baryon current breaks the rotational symmetry of the system , and it resembles the one - plane wave loff state .\nwe further describe the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework , and show that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding pseudo nambu - goldstone current .\nwe show this nambu - goldstone currents generation state can naturally cover the gluon phase as well as the one - plane wave loff state .\nwe also point out that , when charge neutrality condition is required , there exists a narrow unstable loff ( us - loff ) window , where not only off - diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon can not avoid the magnetic instability\n. the diagonal gluon s magnetic instability in this us - loff window can not be cured by off - diagonal gluon condensate in color superconducting phase .\nmore interestingly , this us - loff window will also show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluid system .\nthe us - loff window brings us a new challenge .\nwe need new thoughts on understanding how a bcs supercondutor will be eventually destroyed by increasing the mismatch , we also need to develop new methods to really resolve the instability problem\n. some methods developed in unconventional superconductor field , e.g. , high-@xmath166 superconductor , might be helpful .\ntill now , the results on instabilities are based on mean - field ( mf ) approximation .\nthe bcs theory at mf can describe strongly coherent or rigid superconducting state very well .\nhowever , as we pointed out in @xcite , with the increase of mismatch , the low degrees of freedom in the system have been changed .\nfor example , the gapless quasi - particle excitations in the gapless phase , and the small meissner mass square of the off - diagonal gluons around @xmath186 .\nthis indicates that these quasi - quarks and gluons become low degrees of freedom in the system , their fluctuations become more important . in order to correctly describe the system ,\nthe low degrees of freedom should be taken into account properly .\nthe work toward this direction is still in progress .\nthe author thanks m. alford , f.a .\nbais , k. fukushima , e. gubankova , m. hashimoto , t. hatsuda , l.y .\nhong , w.v .\nliu , m. mannarelli , t. matsuura , y. nambu , k. rajagopal , h.c .\nren , d. rischke , t. schafer , a. schmitt , i. shovkovy , d. t. son , m. tachibana , z.tesanovic , x. g. wen , z. y. weng , f. wilczek and k. yang for valuable discussions .\nthe work is supported by the japan society for the promotion of science fellowship program .\nr.  rapp , t.  schfer , e.  v.  shuryak and m.  velkovsky , phys .\nlett .   * 81 * , 53 ( 1998 ) ; m.  alford , k.  rajagopal , and f.  wilczek , phys .\nb * 422 * , 247 ( 1998 ) .\nm.  g.  alford , k.  rajagopal and f.  wilczek , nucl .\n* b537 * , 443 ( 1999 ) .\nd.  t.  son , phys .  rev .\nd * 59 * , 094019 ( 1999 ) ; d.  k.  hong , v.  a.  miransky , i.  a.  shovkovy , and l.  c.  r.  wijewardhana , phys .\nd * 61 * , 056001 ( 2000 ) ; d.  k.  hong , nucl .\n* b582 * , 451 ( 2000 ) ; t.  schfer and f.  wilczek , phys .\nd * 60 * , 114033 ( 1999 ) ; r.d .\npisarski and d.h .\nrischke , phys .\nd * 61 * , 051501 ( 2000 ) ; s.  d.  h.  hsu and m.  schwetz , nucl .  phys .  *\nb572 * , 211 ( 2000 ) ; w.  e.  brown , j.  t.  liu , and h .- c .\nren , phys .\nd * 61 * , 114012 ( 2000 ) .\nt.  schfer , nucl .\n* b575 * , 269 ( 2000 ) ; i.  a.  shovkovy and l.  c.  r.  wijewardhana , phys .\nb * 470 * , 189 ( 1999 ) .\nk.  rajagopal and f.  wilczek , hep -
