    "abstract": " large numbers of supernovae ( sne ) have been discovered in recent years , and many more will be found in the near future . once discovered , further study of a sn and its possible use as an astronomical tool ( e.g. , as a distance estimator ) require knowledge of the sn type . \n current classification methods rely almost solely on the analysis of sn spectra to determine their type . \n however , spectroscopy may not be possible or practical when sne are faint , numerous , or discovered in archival studies . \n we present a classification method for sne based on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones , calculated from a large database of multi - epoch optical spectra of nearby events . \n we discuss the capabilities and limitations of this method . \n for example , type ia sne at redshifts @xmath0 can be distinguished from most other sn types during the first few weeks of their evolution , based on @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 colors . \n type ii - p sne have distinct ( very red ) colors at late ( @xmath3  d ) stages . \n broadband photometry through standard johnson - cousins @xmath4 filters can be useful to classify sne out to @xmath5 . \n the use of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath6 filters allows the extension of our classification method to even higher redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , and the use of infrared bands , to @xmath8 . \n we demonstrate the application of this method to a recently discovered sn from the sdss . \n finally , we outline the observational data required to further improve the sensitivity of the method , and discuss prospects for its use on future sn samples . \n community access to the tools developed is provided by a dedicated website .

    "article": "the study of supernovae ( sne ) has greatly advanced in the last few years .\nintensive and highly automated monitoring of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , li et al .\n1996 ; treffers et al .\n1997 ; filippenko et al .\n2001 ; dimai 2001 ; qiu & hu 2001 ) , wide - field , moderately deep surveys ( e.g. , reiss et al . 1998 ; gal - yam & maoz 1999 , 2002 ; hardin et al . 2000 ; schaefer 2000 ) , and cosmology - oriented , deep , high - redshift sn search projects ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ; schmidt et al .\n1998 ) now combine to yield hundreds of new sn discoveries each year .\nambitious programs that are currently planned or underway [ e.g. , the nearby supernova factory  aldering et al .\n2001 ; the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) \nperlmutter et al . 2000 ; automated sn detections in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data  vanden berk et al .\n2001 ; miknaitis et al .\n2001b ; see also @xmath9 promise to increase these numbers by at least an order of magnitude .\nsne are heterogeneous events , empirically classified into many subtypes , with the main classification criteria based on spectral properties .\nbriefly , sne of type ii show hydrogen lines in their spectra while sne of type i do not .\neach of these types is further divided into subtypes , the commonly used ones including ia , ib , and ic , as well as ii - p , ii - l , iin , and iib .\nsee filippenko ( 1997 ) for a thorough review and @xmath10 for more details .\nit is widely accepted that sne  ia are produced from the thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf at or near the chandrasekhar limit , while all other types of sne ( ib , ic , and ii ) result from the core collapse of massive stars .    while understanding sne , their properties , and their underlying physics is of great interest , sne are also useful tools in the study of various other important problems .\nsne  ia are excellent distance indicators , and their hubble diagram has been used to determine the local value of the hubble constant ( e.g. , parodi et al .\n2000 , and references therein ) .\nthe extension of the hubble diagram to higher redshifts ( @xmath11 ) probes the geometry and matter - energy content of the universe ( e.g. , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) .\ntwo independent groups using large samples of high-@xmath12 sne  ia presented a strong case for a current acceleration of the universe ( riess et al .\n1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999\n; see filippenko 2001 for a summary ) , consistent with a nonzero cosmological constant , @xmath13 .\nsubsequent work ( riess et al . 2001 ) based on a single sn  ia at @xmath14 possibly shows the transition from matter - dominated deceleration to @xmath13-dominated acceleration at @xmath15 .\nsne  ii - p can also be used as primary distance estimators through the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; schmidt , kirshner , & eastman 1992 ; schmidt et al .\n1994 ) , as was most recently demonstrated by hamuy et al .\n( 2001 ) and leonard et al .\n( 2002a , b ) .\nleonard et al . ( 2002a ; see also hflich et al . 2001 ) suggest that distances good to @xmath16% ( @xmath17 ) may be possible for sne  ii - p by simply measuring the mean plateau visual magnitude , obviating the need for a complete epm analysis unless a more accurate distance is desired .\nhamuy & pinto ( 2002 ) refine this technique , showing that a measurement of the plateau magnitude and the ejecta expansion velocity potentially yields a considerably smaller uncertainty in the derived distance .\nsn rates as a function of redshift probe the star - formation history of the universe , the physical mechanisms leading to sne  ia , and the cosmological parameters ( jorgensen et al .\n1997 ; sadat et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) .\nsn rates are also important for understanding the chemical enrichment and energetics of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , matteucci & greggio 1986 ) and the intracluster medium ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews 1998 , 2001 ; lowenstein 2000 ; gal - yam , maoz , & sharon 2002 ) .\nonce discovered , the study of a particular sn , and its use as a tool for any of the applications above , is almost always based on spectroscopic verification and classification .\nthe information extracted from sn spectra usually includes ( but is not limited to ) the sn type , redshift , and age ( relative to the dates of explosion or peak brightness ) .\nspectroscopic followup may not always be possible or practical .\nsne , especially at high redshift , may be too faint for spectroscopy , even with the largest , 10-m - class telescopes currently available .\nspectroscopy is also not practical if large numbers ( hundreds or thousands ) of sne are detected within a relatively short time , as is expected to happen in the case of the sdss southern strip ( miknaitis et al .\n2001b ; see also @xmath18 ) .\nfinally , spectroscopy is impossible for sne discovered in archival data ( gal - yam & maoz 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ; gal - yam et al .\n2002 ) , which have long faded by the time they are found .\nthe discovery of sne in archival data is expected to become frequent as high - quality astronomical databases become larger and more accessible , especially with the development of projects such as astrovirtel ( http://www.stecf.org/astrovirtel ) and the national virtual observatory ( brunner , djorgovski , & szalay 2001 ) .\nthe goal of the present work is to facilitate the scientific exploitation of sne for which no spectroscopic observations exist .\nthe obvious alternative for spectroscopy is multi - color broadband photometry .\nthe potential utility of such an approach is demonstrated , in principle , by the use of the `` photometric redshift '' method to infer the redshift and type of galaxies and quasars that are too faint or too numerous to observe spectroscopically ( e.g. , weymann et al .\n1999 ; richards et al . 2001 ) . applying a similar method\nto sne is not straightforward since , unlike galaxies , the spectra of sne vary strongly with type , redshift , and time . while photometric approaches to the study of faint sne have been discussed before ( dahln & fransson 1999 ; sullivan et al .\n2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ) , no general treatment has been presented thus far .    in a recent paper , dahln & goobar ( 2002 , hereafter dg2002 )\ntackle the issue of sn classification for the case of deep , cosmology - oriented , high-@xmath12 sn searches .\ntheir treatment relies heavily on the particular observational setup used by these programs  i.e. , the comparison of images obtained @xmath194 weeks apart , designed to detect sne before , or at , peak brightness . as these authors show , this setup is strongly biased toward the discovery of sne  ia .\nthe main theme of dg2002 is the selection of the high-@xmath12 sne  ia from an observed sample , using photometry of the host galaxies and the sne themselves . for the particular observational setup\nthey consider , dg2002 also wish to minimize the contamination of the sample by non - ia sne . to do this\n, they use the models of dahln & fransson ( 1999 ) and demonstrate their ability to reject most non - ia sne based on their colors and lower brightness . however , the models used for the population of non - ia sne are based on many parameters and assumptions , such as the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra , peak brightness , light curves , and relative fractions of non - ia sne , that are not precisely known even in the local universe , let alone at high redshift .\nwhile dg2002 seek only to identify high-@xmath12 sne  ia detected by a particular observational setup , we present general methods that apply to all the major sn subtypes and can be used for a wide range of sn surveys , including searches that are similar to those described by dg2002 .\nclassification of sne using broadband colors is such a complex problem that , as we show below , a full solution ( i.e. , deriving sn type , redshift , and age from a few broadband colors ) is probably impossible .\nhowever we will argue here that the problem may be simplified .\ntype , redshift , and age need not all be determined simultaneously .\nmost sne are associated with host galaxies that are readily detectable .\none can therefore infer the redshift of the sn from that of the host , derived either from spectroscopy ( that may be obtained long after the sn has faded ) or using a photometric redshift .\nin fact , for sne that are detected in well - studied parts of the sky , the redshift information often already exists .\ngal - yam et al .\n( 2002 ) recently demonstrated this with sne they discovered in archival _\nhubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images of well - studied galaxy - cluster fields .\nfive of the six apparent sne they found ( and all of those clearly associated with a host ) had redshift information in the literature .\nfor the majority of sne , the redshift can thus be obtained from observations of the host , and treated as a known parameter .    in the absence of a spectrum , the sn age\nmay sometimes be revealed by measuring the photometric light curve of the event .\nadmittedly , such followup may still pose a problem for faint or very numerous events , and is generally not possible for archival sne ( see riess et al .\n2001 for an exception ) .\nhowever , for many of the scientific uses of sne ( e.g. , the derivation of sn rates ) , the age of each event is immaterial .\ndetermination of the type of a sn is crucial for most of the applications discussed above .\nthe sn type can be securely determined only from observations of the active sn itself .\nwhile some information can be gleaned from the host ( e.g. , elliptical galaxies are known to contain only sne  ia ) , this information is limited and such reasoning may not hold at high redshifts .\nwe therefore concentrate our efforts on using multi - color broadband photometry to classify sne .\nsince we want to constrain the type of a sn with an arbitrary ( but known ) redshift , it is not simple to utilize broadband photometry ; k - corrections for sne of all types , and at all ages , are currently unknown . instead , we have compiled a large spectral database of nearby , well - observed sne .\nthese spectra are used to calculate synthetic broadband colors for various sn types through a given filter set at a given redshift .\nthe temporal coverage of our compilation allows us to draw paths in color space which show the time evolution of each sn type . inspecting the resulting diagrams\n, one can then look for regions which are either populated by a single type of sn , or that are avoided by various sn types .\nthe observed photometric colors of a candidate sn with a known redshift can then be plotted on the relevant diagrams , and constraints on its type and age may be drawn .\nas we show in @xmath20 , the type of a sn can sometimes be uniquely determined .\nwhen this is not the case , the type may still be deduced by supplementing the color information with other available data on the sn , such as constraints on its brightness , and information ( even if very limited ) on its variability ( e.g. , whether its flux is rising or declining ) .\nour sn classification method is based on colors , determined by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each event . by definition\n, such a method can differentiate only between sn subtypes with unique spectral characteristics .\nhypothetically , two sne with very different photometric properties ( e.g. , light curves , peak magnitudes ) , but having similar seds at all ages , would not be distinguished by our method .\nthe sn classification scheme we adopt needs , therefore , to rely only on spectral properties .\nfortunately , the common classification of sne ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) is mostly based on their spectra , with one notable exception which we discuss below .\nit is customary to divide the sn population into two main subgroups : type ii sne , which show prominent hydrogen lines in their spectra , and type i sne , which do not ( minkowski 1941 ) .\ntype i sne are further divided into type ia whose spectra are characterized by a deep absorption trough around @xmath21   , attributed to blueshifted si  ii @xmath226347 , 6371 lines , type ib that show prominent he  i lines , and type ic that lack both si  ii and he  i ( e.g. , matheson et al .\n2001 , and references therein ) .\ntype ii sne are divided ( e.g. , barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1979 ; doggett & branch 1985 ) into two subclasses according to their light - curve shape : sne  ii - p show a pronounced plateau during the first @xmath23  d of their evolution , and sne  ii - l decline in a linear fashion in a magnitude vs. time plot , similar to sne  i. further studies ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) show that sne  ii - p have characteristic spectra , with the h@xmath24 line showing a p - cygni profile . on the other hand , sne  ii - l have not been well characterized spectroscopically , and the best spectroscopically studied events ( sne 1979c and 1980k ) are considered to be photometrically peculiar ( `` overluminous '' ; miller & branch 1990 ) relative to other sne ii - l . during the 1990s ,\nthe focus in studies of sne  ii shifted from photometry to spectroscopy .\ntwo new subtypes have emerged .\nsne  iin show narrow h@xmath24 emission ( e.g. , schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) , and sne  iib are transition objects that first appear as relatively normal sne  ii , but evolve to resemble sne  ib ( filippenko 1988 ; filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ; matheson et al .\n2001 , and references therein ) . for our study ,\nonly sn subtypes with well - defined spectral properties are meaningful .\nwe therefore consider henceforth only sne ii - p , iin , and iib as subtypes of the sn  ii population .\nsne  iin and iib are probably a large fraction of the sn population that was previously classified as type ii - l based only on their light - curve shape ( approximately half of the sn  ii population , e.g. , cappellaro et al .\nreviewing the latest spectral databases available to us , we estimate that most of the sne  ii discovered by current surveys belong to the spectroscopically defined subtypes ii - p , iin , and iib ( see below ) .\nsne are a veritable zoo , with many peculiar and even unique events , from luminous hypernovae ( e.g. , sn 1998bw  galama et al .\n1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ; sn 1997cy  germany et al .\n2000 ; turatto et al . 2000 ; sn 1997ef  iwamoto et al .\n2000 ; matheson et al . 2001 ) to faint sn 1987a - like events ( e.g. , arnett et al . 1989 , and references therein ) , and sn `` impostors '' ( e.g. , filippenko et al . 1995a ; van dyk et al . 2000 , and references therein ) .\ncurrently , we limit our discussion to sn types that are not extremely rare , and are well - defined and well - characterized spectroscopically . assuming that the sne reported in the iau circulars are representative of the sn population that is discovered by current programs\n, we estimate that , collectively , the well - defined subtypes we consider ( ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) constitute at least 83% , and probably more , of the entire population .\nfor instance , we consider all the sne that were discovered during the year 2000 and whose type was either reported in iau circulars , or alternatively could be constrained by data available to us . among 110 such events ,\nthere were 54 type ia , 5 type ib , 5 type ic , 8 type iin , one type iib , two peculiar sne  ia , one peculiar sn  ib , and 34 events which were reported just as `` type ii . ''\nusing available spectra or data reported in the iau circulars , we learn that of the latter 34 events , 18 show a p - cygni profile in h@xmath24 , typical of sne  ii - p , 13 events may or may not belong to the ii - p , iin , or iib subtypes , and 3 events are definitely not ii - p , iin , or iib events .\nhence 91 events ( 83% ) belong to our spectroscopically defined sn sample ( types ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) , 13 events ( 12% ) may or may not be of these types , and just 6 events ( 5% ) are known to be of types not included in our database .\nit is therefore likely that analysis based on our database will be relevant to the large majority of sne discovered by current programs .\nthis is probably also true for future programs that will use similar search methods .\nwe are aware that a large population of intrinsically faint sne ( e.g. , sn 1987a - like ) may be underrepresented in current sn statistics .\nanalysis of future surveys that will be sensitive to such events may require their inclusion in the spectral database .\nthe core of our classification algorithm is the spectral database : a compilation of optical spectra of nearby sne .\nmost of the these spectra were obtained with the shane 3-m reflector at lick observatory .\nthe typical resolution is better than @xmath25    ( full width at half maximum ) , and the majority of the data used cover the range 320010000   . some spectra with narrower coverage ( approximately 40008000   ) are also used .\nall spectra were either obtained at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) , or calibrated by simultaneous photometry , to ensure that spectral shape distortions due to wavelength - dependent atmospheric refraction are not significant .\ntelluric lines were removed , generally through division by the spectrum of a featureless star . according to the galactic coordinates of the observed sn\n, the spectra were corrected for galactic reddening , using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) .\nthe working edition of the database was constructed in the following manner . for each of the well - defined sn subtypes mentioned above ,\nwe have selected a prototype .\nthe main criterion was the availability of spectra with wide wavelength coverage and multiple epochs .\nin addition , a few complementary spectra of other events were included in order to verify consistency and fill gaps in the temporal evolution , when needed .\ntable 1 lists the sne whose spectra constitute our database , with the prototypical event for each subtype listed first .\nwe have specifically avoided events that were known to either suffer considerable extinction , or to be otherwise peculiar . for sne\nia , peculiar ( overluminous , sn 1991t - like , or underluminous , sn 1991bg - like ) events are rather well characterized , and may be quite common , at least in low - redshift environments ( li et al .\nour main database includes only spectra of normal sne  ia , but we examine the effects of peculiar sne  ia in @xmath26 below .\nall spectra were de - redshifted according to the host - galaxy redshift taken from the ned database .\nafter redshifting the spectra again to a chosen redshift ( see below ) , the telluric features were re - applied before deriving synthetic colors .      using our spectral database , we calculate the synthetic colors of sne at a chosen redshift through the johnson - cousins @xmath4 ( johnson 1965 ; cousins 1976 ;\nsee moro & munari 2000 for details ) , bessell @xmath27 ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and sdss @xmath6 ( fukugita et al .\n1996 ; stoughton et al .\n2002 ) filter systems .\nif a filter s bandpass is not fully covered by a sn spectrum , the flux in the missing spectral region is extrapolated linearly using the median value of the spectrum .\neach calculated magnitude that includes such an extrapolation is assigned an error equal to the amount of flux in the extrapolated part of the spectrum , thus providing a conservative error estimate .\nthe resulting synthetic photometry is then displayed on color - color diagrams .\nnote that in all the plots we present , the ordinate and abscissa are composed of colors consisting of adjacent bands ( e.g. , @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 , @xmath29 vs. @xmath1 etc . ) .\nsince most of the spectra in our database have a wide wavelength range , error bars will hence generally appear only on one axis .    in the following section we present such diagrams , discuss their use in the classification of sne discovered by various programs , and derive a few general rules .\nnote that the choice of colors that gives the best sn type differentiation , apart from the obvious dependence on the filter system used , also depends on redshift . for optimal results , for each sn ( having a known redshift and some observed colors )\none needs to search for color - color diagrams that give the maximum information content .\nobvious space limitations allow us to present below just a few representative examples of such plots .\nsimilar plots for arbitrary values of @xmath12 may be obtained from our website ( http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/$\\sim$dovip/typing ) .\nin figure 1 , we compare our data on sne  ia to template colors of normal sne  ia compiled by leibundgut ( 1988 ) .\none can see that our calculated colors follow the expected path in color space , with a small scatter ( @xmath30 mag ) , consistent with the previously measured dispersion in sne  ia colors ( e.g. , tripp 1998 ; phillips et al . 1999 , and references therein ) .\nsince our spectral database includes spectra of sn 1994d , which was somewhat bluer at early times than average sne  ia ( richmond et al .\n1995 ) , our treatment covers an even wider variety in the colors of early sne  ia . from this plot\n, we can estimate the expected width of color - color paths for normal sne  ia to be @xmath300.3 mag .\nnote that sne  ia follow a complex curve in color space , with a distinct turn - around point @xmath16  d after peak brightness .\nthe underlying spectral evolution is nontrivial .\nlike most sne , the continuum slope of early sne  ia is very blue , and becomes redder as the sn grows older .\nthis process is dominant during the first weeks of sn  ia evolution , but is later countered by the emergence of strong emission lines in the blue part of the spectrum ( restframe 40005500   ) .\nthe line - dominated spectrum results in unique colors for late - time ( @xmath31  d ) sne  ia ( e.g. , figure 3 , below ) .    in figure 2 our results for sne  ii\n- p are plotted against the observed photometry of the recent , well - observed sn 1999em .\nit can be clearly seen that the results agree perfectly up to around 70  d past maximum brightness , where a bifurcation appears in our calculated color path .\nour spectral data for sne  ii - p is based on three different events ( sne 1992h , 1999em , and 2001x ) .\nthe three points that have considerably lower @xmath28 values ( at 110 , 127 , and 165  d ) have all been calculated from the spectra of sn 2001x , which up to that age was consistent with the other sne  ii - p used .\nthis demonstrates the well - known variety of late - type spectra of sne  ii ( filippenko 1997 ) . in subsequent plots ,\nwe retain both branches of `` old '' sne  ii - p ( with the one derived from spectra of sn 2001x marked , when significantly different , in a darker shade ) , and treat the color space bounded by them as a possible location for such sne .\ncontrary to sne  ia , the color path of sne  ii - p is quite smooth .\nthe underlying spectral evolution is driven mostly by the change in the continuum slope , from very blue at early ages , growing redder with time ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) .\nlate - time ( @xmath31  d ) spectra become increasingly dominated by strong and broad emission lines , especially h@xmath24 , that give sne  ii - p their distinct late - time colors ( see , e.g. , fig .\n3 , below ) .      in figure 3 ( top panel )\n, we show the color paths of all types of sne at zero redshift in @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 .\none sees that many sne before maximum light are blue , with @xmath32 mag . while most young sne  ii have @xmath33 mag , young sne  ia have bluer @xmath29 colors ( @xmath34 mag ) but redder @xmath28 colors , around @xmath35 mag .\nit is also evident that old ( @xmath36  d ) sne  ia have unique colors ( @xmath37 mag , @xmath38 mag ) , as do some of the sne  ii - p ( ages 19100  d ) which have the reddest colors of all sne . the arrow shows the reddening effect corresponding to @xmath39 mag of extinction , assuming the galactic reddening curve of cardelli et al .\none can see that the unique colors of young ( @xmath40  d ) and very old ( @xmath31  d ) sne  ia can not be masked even by significant reddening in their host .\nfurthermore , we note that high extinction values are rare for sne  ia . for example , only 3 among 49 sne  ia ( @xmath41 ) studied by the cfa and caln / tololo programs , and presented in riess et al .\n( 1999 ) , have @xmath42 mag .\nconversely , because reddening works only in one direction , some candidates with appropriate observed colors can be uniquely determined to be sne  ia\n.    however , the center of the diagram is populated by sne of all types . for example , a zero - redshift sn , of unknown type , with colors of @xmath43 mag , @xmath44 mag , would be impossible to classify based on these colors only .\nbut the middle panel of figure 3 shows that if one examines an additional color , such as @xmath1 , this degeneracy can be partly lifted .\nfor the same @xmath45  mag , there is a spread in @xmath1 that can shed some light on the sn type .\na value of @xmath46 mag would favor a type ia classification , while a positive value would suggest one of the core - collapse types .\naddition of an @xmath2 measurement ( fig .\n3 , bottom panel ) would narrow the options even further , since in this color , at this redshift , different types have distinct values , from the bluest sne  ia to the reddest types ( ib , ic , and ii - p ) . looking at the reddening vectors in the middle and bottom panels of figure 3 , we again note that only heavy extinction ( @xmath47 mag ) can move sne  ia into color regions populated by core - collapse sne .    before we proceed , we briefly comment on the effects of host - galaxy contamination .\nsince our approach assumes the redshift of a given sn is a known parameter , and this is commonly available through the observation of the host galaxy , some data on the galaxy should exist .\nit should therefore generally be possible to subtract the galaxy s light from the sn photometry . to study the effect of non - subtraction of host - galaxy light , or imperfect subtraction , we parameterize the amount of the contaminating galactic flux , at a given epoch , by the ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mean flux of the host galaxy and sn spectra , respectively , calculated over the wavelength range of the spectrum of the sn .\nwe consider contamination as negligible , when it is not likely to make one type of sn look like another .\nfirst , we find that for all types of sne and hosts , when @xmath51 the effect of contamination is indeed negligible . for young sne  ia , the worst - case scenario would be the contamination by a red elliptical host that could make them look like redder core - collapse sne . when observed in restframe blue colors ( e.g. , @xmath52 ) , this effect becomes significant only when @xmath53 , but if red bands ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) are used , contaminated sne  ia attain colors similar to those of the core - collapse population already at @xmath55 .\nthe opposite effect ( i.e. , of bluer host galaxies on red core - collapse sne ) is much weaker , so contamination by spiral hosts is unlikely to mix core - collapse sne with young sne  ia . only heavy contamination ( @xmath56 ) by a very blue , star - forming host galaxy can make a red sn  ii - p appear similar to a bluer sn  ia on a @xmath52 color - color diagram . in redder bands ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) ,\neven this extreme case causes negligible shifts in color .\nwe conclude that if the host galaxy light has been subtracted , at least roughly , from the measured sn photometry , residual contamination has no significant implication . a large contribution from an underlying host\n( e.g. , with a flux similar to that of the sn itself ) that has not been removed may mask blue sne  ia as core - collapse events , but is unlikely to make red core - collapse events appear as sne  ia . in the discussion below\n, we therefore neglect contamination of the sn photometry by light from the underlying host galaxy .      with increasing redshift , the available spectral information shifts to longer - wavelength filters .\nthe top panel of figure 4 demonstrates how well sne  ia can be differentiated from other types at @xmath57 on a @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 diagram . on the @xmath2 axis\nthe only sne with negative values are sne  ia .\nthey are also the only type with @xmath1 color greater than 0.6 mag while @xmath2 is smaller than 0.3 mag . during most of the temporal evolution of sne  ia ,\ntheir distinction from other types is practically unaffected by host galaxy dust reddening , as can be seen from the vector plotted ( the reddening is calculated in the sn rest frame ) .\nthe middle panel of figure 4 shows a similar diagram computed at @xmath58 .\nclassification is obviously more difficult .\nstill , sne  ii - p ( including `` sn 2001x - like , '' see @xmath59 ) at ages above 100  d have @xmath2 values higher than sne of other types ( at all ages ) .\nclose to peak flux , sne  ia have @xmath1 colors of a few tenths of a magnitude bluer than other types , and again , this distinction is not sensitive to reddening . even where all types seem to mingle , at @xmath60 mag and @xmath61 mag , sne  ia and ii - p have @xmath1 values that are 0.2 mag higher than other types . should one of these types be rendered unlikely by other data , such as a sn that is too bright to be a sn  ii - p , the classification can become unique or nearly so .\nfor example , sne  ii - p can be unambiguously identified by their light curves ; no other sn type has a roughly constant @xmath54 brightness over such a long period . in principle , two @xmath62-band ( restframe ) observations separated by , say , 30  d can unambiguously identify a sn  ii - p .    at redshifts\nhigher than 0.6 , the @xmath62 band samples the restframe uv , not covered by our spectral database .\nthus , only one color ( @xmath2 ) remains in the johnson - cousins system .\nthe sdss filter system has 3 filters ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath12 ) in the approximate range covered by the @xmath65 and @xmath66 filters , but extending farther into the red by @xmath67   . using this system\n, we can extend our analysis to higher redshifts .\nthis is demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure 4 for sne at @xmath7 .\nagain , late - time sne  ii - p are significantly redder than other types ( @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 mag ) , while early - time sne  ia are significantly bluer ( @xmath70 mag and @xmath71 mag ) , and remain so even in the presence of significant reddening by dust . at later times\n( over two months ) , sne  ia escape from the vicinity of other types and reach @xmath72 values above 1.2 mag .\nsne  iin at this redshift appear to be isolated from other types .\nas we move even farther up the redshift scale the use of infrared ( ir ) filters is required . between @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,\nclassification would require a combination of optical and ir photometry .\nfigure 5 ( top panel ) shows that at @xmath75 , sne  ia have distinct blue colors ( @xmath76 mag and @xmath77 mag ) at almost all ages , sne  ii - p develop very red @xmath78 colors ( @xmath79 mag ) two months after peak , while sne  ib and ic are the only ones that have @xmath80 colors that are redder than @xmath81 mag .\nas before , these distinctions are hardly affected by extinction . between @xmath82 and 2.5 our spectra shift into the region covered by the bessell @xmath27 filters .\nin the bottom panel of figure 5 ( @xmath83 ) , one can see that sne  ia have generally lower @xmath80 colors ( @xmath84 mag ) , except between ages of one to two months , shared perhaps by very early type iin , ii - p , and ic events .\nsne  ib and ic are the only objects to have both @xmath80 and @xmath85 above unity .\nthe use of synthetic colors , calculated from spectra of local sne , to classify high-@xmath12 events , assumes that sn spectra do not evolve strongly with redshift .\nthe similarity , to a first approximation , between the spectra of distant sne  ia and their local counterparts has been demonstrated ( riess et al . 1998 ; coil et al . 2000 ) .\nhowever , for all other types of sne , high - quality spectra of distant ( @xmath86 ) events are largely unavailable .\nsince we use synthetic broadband colors , only significant evolution in either the spectral slope or strong emission or absorption features will influence our classification method . nevertheless , this is a caveat that must be addressed once spectra of distant core - collapse sne become available .\nwe now examine the colors of peculiar sne  ia and their implication for our classification method . following the same approach used earlier , we have compiled spectra of the most extreme varieties of peculiar sne  ia : overluminous ( sn 1991t - like ; e.g. , filippenko et al .\n1992a ) and underluminous ( sn 1991bg - like ; e.g. , filippenko et al .\n1992b ) objects , as well as spectra of sn 2000cx , a unique sn  ia that may be considered a subtype of its own ( li et al .\ntable 2 provides observational details for these objects .    inspecting figure 6 ( top panel ) ,\nwhich shows the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 colors of the various sn  ia subtypes at zero redshift , we see that , although the paths of peculiar sne  ia in color space are different from those of `` normal '' sne  ia , they populate the same general region . on the other hand , in the middle panel of figure 6 , showing @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 colors at zero redshift , one can see that underluminous sne  ia have significantly larger @xmath2 values ( by 0.20.6 mag ) than those of all other sne  ia , and are therefore liable to mix with the redder core - collapse population .\nthis is illustrated in the bottom panel of the same figure , where indeed , underluminous sne  ia at early ages ( prior to @xmath87  d ) can not be distinguished from core - collapse sne .\nlater in their evolution , these events acquire unique colors ( @xmath88 mag , @xmath89 mag ) that are different from all other types of sne .    as sn 1991t - like and sn 2000cx - like events are almost always bluer than `` normal '' sne  ia , they are generally easier to distinguish from core - collapse sne , and pose no special problem in our analysis .\nsne  ia of the underluminous , redder , sn 1991bg - like variety are hard to distinguish from core - collapse sne at early ages , and may be lost in color - based classification .\nthis problem is quite limited at low redshift , where underluminous sne  ia are rare ( @xmath90% of the sn  ia population ; li et al .\n2001a ) , and may be totally negligible at higher redshifts where , empirically , sn 1991bg - like events have not been found at all ( li et al .\n2001a ) .\nhigh - redshift sn search programs that focus on finding sne  ia for use as distance indicators encounter the problem of sample contamination by other sn types , especially a luminous variety of sne  ic ( riess et al .\n1998 ; clocchiatti et al . 2000 ) .\nthe problem is two - fold .\nfirst , unwanted non - ia sne take up precious telescope resources for followup spectroscopy .\nsecond , when only low signal - to - noise ratio spectra of faint , high-@xmath12 events are available , luminous sne  ic may masquerade as sne  ia .\nthe latter problem is acute at high @xmath12 , since at these redshifts the sn  ia hallmark ( the si  ii @xmath91 trough ) is shifted out of the optical range , and sne  ic spectra lack the telltale h or he lines that distinguish sne  ii and sne  ib , respectively .\nspectra with high signal - to - noise ratios can provide definitive classifications ( coil et al .\n2000 ) , but these are time - consuming to obtain .\n> from figure 7 , one sees that color information may help , at least partially , to alleviate this problem .\nwe confirm and quantify the well known `` rule of thumb '' ( e.g. , riess et al .\n2001 ) : sne  ic are red compared to sne  ia at a similar redshift .\none can see that , for sne at ages that are relevant for high-@xmath12 search programs , designed to discover sne near peak brightness , sne  ia are typically 0.5 mag bluer in @xmath72 than sne  ic , well above the typical effects of reddening . while it is true that rising ( pre - maximum ) sne  ic have colors similar to those of older ( @xmath92 weeks past maximum ) sne  ia , even the most basic variability information ( e.g. , whether the object is rising or declining ) breaks this degeneracy .\nfigure 7 also illustrates the fact that most of the information at this redshift can be obtained from the @xmath72 color alone , and the inclusion of @xmath12-band information does not appear to be cost - effective .\nsn 2001fg was the third sn reported from sdss data .\nthis event was discovered on 15 october 2001 ut by vanden berk et al .\n( 2001 ) with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 mag . inspecting the color - color diagram calculated for the appropriate redshift ( @xmath96 , see below ) , one can see ( fig .\n8) that the type and approximate age of the sn candidate can be deduced .\nthe diagram clearly indicates this is a sn  ia , around one month old .\nfollowup spectra by filippenko & chornock ( 2001 ) using the keck ii 10-m telescope reveal that the object is indeed a sn  ia , at @xmath96 .\nthe spectrum is similar to those of sne  ia about two months past maximum brightness .\nthis age , at the time of the spectral observation ( 18 november ut ) , implies an age around one month past maximum brightness at discovery , confirming our diagnosis .\na fully `` blind '' application would have , of course , required an independent photometric or spectroscopic redshift for the sn host galaxy .\nthe method presented here can become significantly more powerful when more observational data become available .\nfaint , high-@xmath12 sne are usually observed at optical wavelengths ( i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath65 , or @xmath66 bands ) . in order to use these bands for classification , knowledge of the restframe uv spectrum\nis required .\ncurrently , uv spectra are available for only a handful of objects , while methods like those discussed here require multi - epoch coverage of several objects for each sn subtype .\nfurther characteristics of the various sn types , most notably the absolute peak magnitudes and their scatter for every sn type , the typical light curves , and the relative rates of the different types , would also be useful . with such data in hand , one could use the limiting magnitude of a survey to calculate , for each sn type , at what epochs it is bright enough to be observed , thus removing some degeneracy in the classification .\na further enhancement could be introduced to deal with the regions in color space that are populated by several different sn types . using the typical light curves and known peak magnitudes for all types , and the relative rates\n, one could calculate the amount of time a sn of a certain type spends within a region and deduce the likelihood that an observed event belongs to a particular type .\nas already mentioned in @xmath97 , work along these lines has been presented by dg2002 , who replace missing observational data with rough estimates or models .\nsne are generally discovered by their variability .\nhowever , the tools developed in this paper may enable one to detect sne by their colors alone .\nindeed , such methods have recently been discussed for the detection of another kind of transient phenomenon  gamma - ray burst afterglows ( rhoads 2001 ) .\nmulti - color wide - field surveys ( e.g. , becker et al .\n2001 ; jannuzi et al . 2001 ; sdss  york et al .\n2000 ) that are either planned or already underway may be used to discover large numbers of sne using similar methods . to illustrate this point , we plot in figure 9 the locations of sne of all types at @xmath98 , together with a polygon within which fall the vast majority of stars , asteroids , cataclysmic variables , cepheids , and quasars , as discussed by krisciunas , margon , & szkody ( 1998 ) .\nexcept for late - time sne  ic , all sne have lower @xmath99 values and higher @xmath72 values than these objects .\nsimilar results are obtained for the sn population at @xmath100 00.3 , the redshifts of sne probed by the sdss .\nthis demonstrates the feasibility of color selection of sne , a method which may emerge as an invaluable resource when applied to upcoming , large data sets .\nan exciting application of the methods presented in this paper would be the study of sne discovered in the sdss southern strip . during the months of september to november , when the primary target of the sdss , the north galactic pole , is not visible , the sdss telescope observes parts of the sky near the south galactic pole .\nthe so called `` south equatorial strip '' is a patch of sky that will be imaged repeatedly during the 5-year planned operations of the survey . according to the sdss website ( http://www.sdss.org/documents/5yearbaseline.pdf ) , this 270 square degree area will be imaged @xmath101 times during the 5-year period , or about 4 times each fall , on average . assuming that this sampling enables the discovery of all sne that occur during the @xmath19 months this strip is imaged each year , for five years , the total surveyed area is @xmath102 deg@xmath103-months , or 337.5 deg@xmath103-years .\npain et al .\n( 1996 ) have measured a sn  ia rate of 34 per year per square degree in the magnitude range @xmath104 , and the limiting magnitude of the sdss images in this band is given as @xmath105 mag .\nwe would then expect some 2300 sne  ia each year or a total of over 11,000 sne  ia in this strip .\nthe numbers of sne of all types ( not just ia ) will undoubtedly be even larger .\nmiknaitis et al .\n( 2001b ) report that a systematic search for sne in these data is underway , and the first sne have already been reported ( miknaitis et al . 2001a ; rest , miceli , & covarrubias 2001 ; miknaitis & krisciunas 2001 ) .\nthis huge expected dataset , which may contain an order of magnitude more events than all previously known sne , all with five - band photometry and possibly some variability information , offers an unprecedented resource for sn studies . as an example , sn rates , based on thousands of events , can be computed as a function of sn type , host - galaxy morphology , and redshift .\nhowever , it is clear that obtaining spectra for thousands of faint sne each fall is not feasible .\nphotometric classification could therefore be a valuable option . the sdss supplies five - band information , along with ready - made tools for the derivation of photometric redshifts for all host galaxies , and spectral identification for part of the brighter ones .\nthis makes our approach of using the sn photometry for classification , assuming that the redshift is known , even more appropriate .\nsince no followup is required , such an analysis need not be done in real time  in principle , it may even be carried out long after the project is complete , and all the data are publicly available .    in summary , we have presented a method for the classification of sne , using multi - color broadband photometry .\nwe have shown that the type of a sn may be uniquely determined in some cases . even when this is not the case , constraints on the type may still be drawn .\nin particular , sne  ia may be distinguished from core - collapse sne during long periods in their evolution , for most of the redshifts and filter combinations studied .\nfinally , we have demonstrated the application of our method to a recently discovered sn from the sdss , and we have shown how this technique may become a valuable tool for the analysis of the large sn samples expected to emerge from this and other programs that are already active or will begin soon .\nthis work proves that spectroscopic followup is not always a prerequisite for sne to be a valuable scientific resource , and lays the foundations for the exploitation of large sn samples for which such followup may not be possible .\nwe thank the many people in a.v.f.s group at the university of california , berkeley ( especially a. j. barth , r. chornock , l. c. ho , and j. c. shields ) who , over the years , helped obtain and calibrate the spectra that constitute much of the dataset used in this study .\nwe are grateful to a. fassia , m. hamuy , and y. qiu for supplying us with digital copies of their spectra of sn 1998s , 1999ee , and 1996cb , respectively .\nb. leibundgut generously provided help with sn light curves , and we thank d. branch , e. o. ofek , g. richards , and o. shemmer for useful suggestions .\nwe acknowledge the assistance of the staffs of various observatories ( especially lick ) where the data were taken . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .\nd. m. acknowledges support by the israel science foundation  the jack adler foundation for space research , grant 63/01 -
