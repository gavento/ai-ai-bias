    "article": "in recent time people are too much interested to find some flavor symmetry in order to generate mass and mixing pattern of fermions .\ncontinuous symmetry like @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite symmetry and most popular discrete symmetry , @xmath11 exchange symmetry ( @xmath12@xcite have got some success to describe mass and mixing pattern in leptonic sector . to avoid mass degeneracy of @xmath13 and @xmath14 under @xmath15 symmetry ,\ne. ma and g. rajasekaran in @xcite have introduced first time the @xmath1 symmetry .\nafter this paper , a lot of work have done with this symmetry @xcite-@xcite .\nafter introduction of tri - bi maximal mixing pattern ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18)@xcite , people have tried to fit this mixing pattern through the @xmath1 symmetry . in an well motivated extension of the standard model through the inclusion of @xmath1 discrete symmetry tri - bi\nmaximal mixing pattern comes out in a natural way in the work of altarelli and feruglio @xcite .\nmore precisely , the leptonic mixing arises solely from the neutrino sector since the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .\nthe model @xcite also admits hierarchical masses of the three charged leptons whereas the neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate or hierarchical .\nalthough the model gives rise to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) which is consistent with the chooz - palo verde experimental upper bound ( @xmath21 at 3@xmath22 ) , however , the non - zero and complex value of @xmath0 leads to the possibility to explore _\nviolation in the leptonic sector which is the main goal of many future short and long baseline experiments . within the framework of @xmath23 model , non - zero @xmath0\nis generated either through the radiative correction @xcite or due to the introduction of higher dimensional mass terms @xcite .\ngeneration of non zero complex @xmath0 and possibility of non - zero cp violation has been extensively studied in @xcite for the proposed model of altarelli - feruglio @xcite with explicit soft breaking of @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .    in the model\n@xcite the authors showed that the tri - bi maximal mixing pattern is also generated naturally in the framework of see - saw mechanism with @xmath23 symmetry .\nexact tri - bi maximal pattern forbids at low energy cp violation in leptonic sector .\nthe textures of mass matrices in @xcite could not generate lepton asymmetry also . in the present work ,\nwe investigate the generation of non - zero @xmath0 through see saw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in @xmath2 , the dirac neutrino mass matrix , keeping the same texture of the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix as proposed in ref.@xcite . at first , we have studied in detail perturbation of @xmath2 by adding a small parameter at different entries of @xmath2 and see the variations of three mixing angles in terms of other model parameters considering all of them real .\nwe extend our analysis to the complex case for a suitable texture .\nwe study detailed phenomenology of neutrino mass and mixing including cp violation at low energy , neutrinoless double beta decay and leptogenesis .\nour approach to get nonzero @xmath0 is minimal as we break @xmath1 symmetry explicitly by single parameter in single element of @xmath2 .\ngeneration of cp violation at low energy as well as high energy is also minimal as we consider only one parameter complex .\nwe consider the model proposed in @xcite , which gives rise to diagonal @xmath2 and @xmath24 ( the charged lepton mass matrix ) along with a competent texture of @xmath25 and after see - saw mechanism and diagonalisation gives rise to tri - bimaximal mixing pattern .\nthe model consists of several scalar fields to generate required vacuum alignment to obtain tri - bimaximal mixing . in table i.\n, we have listed the scalar fields and their vev s and representation content under all those symmetries .\n.list of fermion and scalar fields used in this model , @xmath26 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the model is fabricated in such a way that after spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 symmetry , the @xmath15 symmetry remains on the neutrino sector and the charged lepton sector is invariant under @xmath27 symmetry .\nconsider the lagrangian of the model @xcite , @xmath28 after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the charged lepton mass matrix comes out diagonal with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .\nthe neutrino sector gives rise to the following dirac and majorana matrices @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 .\nthe structure of light neutrino mass matrix can be obtained from see - saw formula : @xmath35 where , @xmath36 this is clear from eq.[ssf ] that @xmath37 is the diagonalising matrix for light neutrino mass matrix @xmath38 .\nthe form of @xmath37 is in eq.[tbmix ] which is nothing but the so called tribimaximal mixing matrix . from eq.[ssf ] we have the eigenvalues of @xmath38 : @xmath39 from eq.[tbmix ] we have the mixing angles @xmath16 , @xmath40 and @xmath18 and from eq.[a4ev ] we get the solar and atmospheric mass squared differences as @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and all parameters are real . from the experiments we know @xmath3 is positive and dictates either @xmath44 or @xmath45 .\nif @xmath44 , then it has to be small in order to generate small value of @xmath3 provided @xmath46 is not too small as @xmath3 . but small positive @xmath47 corresponds to same order of magnitude of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which is not acceptable according to the experimental results .\nnow @xmath44 only acceptable for @xmath48 and hierarchy of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained with the singular nature of @xmath4 as in eq.[a4msd ] near @xmath49 .\nthis corresponds to normal hierarchical mass spectrum .\nagain for @xmath50 , @xmath45 is the physical region .\nthis region of @xmath47 makes @xmath51 which is so called inverted ordering of neutrino mass pattern .\nagain @xmath52 should take small value in order to generate small value of @xmath3 .\nfor one complex parameter @xmath53 , we can write the mass differences in the following form @xmath54 in the complex case , positivity of @xmath3 can be obtained either with @xmath44 and @xmath55 or with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the first case with @xmath48 and with @xmath58 one can have normal hierarchical mass spectrum . for the second case hierarchy will be inverted and @xmath59 have to be small . in both case @xmath47 should take the value such that the @xmath60 range also satisfy . the mixing pattern is tri - bi maximal eq.[tbmix ] and it is independent to the fact whether the parameters are real or complex . in this mixing\npattern @xmath61 and non - zero complex @xmath0 is a basic requirement to see the non - zero dirac cp violation .\nnow we concentrate on the issue of leptogenesis in this model .\nthe decay of right handed heavy majorana neutrinos to lepton(charged or neutral ) and scalar(charged or neutral ) generate non - zero lepton asymmetry if i ) c and cp are violated , ii)lepton number is violated and iii ) decay of right handed neutrinos are out of equilibrium .\nwe are in the energy scale where @xmath1 symmetry is broken but the sm gauge group remains unbroken .\nso , the higgs scalars both charged and neutral are physical\n. the cp asymmetry of decay is characterized by a parameter @xmath62 which is defined as @xmath63 spontaneous @xmath1 symmetry breaking generates right handed neutrino mass and the mass matrix @xmath25 obtained is shown in eq .\nwe need to diagonalize @xmath25 in order to go into the physical basis ( mass basis ) of right handed neutrino .\nthis form of @xmath25 gives the diagonalising matrix in the tri - bi maximal form @xmath37 in eq.[tbmix ] : @xmath64 however , the eigenvalues are not real .\nwe need to multiply one diagonal phase matrix @xmath65 with @xmath37 .\nhence , diagonalising matrix @xmath66 relates the flavor basis to eigen basis of right handed neutrino : @xmath67 in this basis the couplings of @xmath68 with leptons and scalars are modified and it will be : @xmath69 at the tree level there there are no asymmetry in the decay of right handed neutrinos . due to the interference between tree level and one loop level diagrams ,\nthe asymmetry is generated .\nthere are vertex diagram and self energy diagram to contribute to the asymmetry @xcite .\nthe vertex contribution is : @xmath70 \\label{vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the self energy part is : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 the key matrix , whose elements are necessary to calculate leptogenesis , is @xmath74 . in this model\n@xmath2 is diagonal and proportional to identity .\nhence , @xmath74 matrix is real diagonal and it is also proportional to identity matrix and it is independent of the form of @xmath75 .\nthe terms for decay asymmetry generated by `` i '' th generation of right handed neutrino @xmath76 for both vertex and self energy contributions are proportional to @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 ) as in eq.[vertex ] and eq .\nall off - diagonal elements of @xmath74 are zero .\nso , decay of all three generation of right handed majorana neutrinos could not generate lepton asymmetry .\nso , in this model of @xmath1 symmetry tri - bi maximal mixing pattern is not compatible with the low energy dirac cp violation as well as high energy cp violation . in order to obtain non - zero @xmath79 ,\nlow energy dirac cp violation and leptogenesis we need to break the @xmath1 symmetry through not only spontaneously but also explicitly introducing some soft @xmath1 symmetry breaking ( soft in the sense that the breaking parameter is small to consider @xmath1 as an approximate symmetry ) terms in the lagrangian .\nwe consider minimal breaking of @xmath1 symmetry through a single parameter in a single element of @xmath2 keeping @xmath25 unaltered as @xmath80 we introduce the breaking by small dimensionless parameter @xmath81 to the @xmath82 element of dirac type yukawa term for neutrino .\nafter spontaneous @xmath83 symmetry breaking it modifies only one element @xmath82 of @xmath2 of neutrino .\nthere are nine possibilities to incorporate the breaking parameter @xmath81 in @xmath2 . we know that after spontaneous @xmath1 symmetry breaking , a residual @xmath15 symmetry appears in neutrino sector .\nthere is a special feature of @xmath15 symmetry which ensures one @xmath84 and one maximal @xmath85 mixing angles .\nthere is one task to check whether our newly introduced explicit breaking term can break @xmath15 symmetry or not .\nthis is important because we need non - zero @xmath79 .\nwe have seen that in one case out of the nine possibilities , residual @xmath15 symmetry remains invariant .\nthis is @xmath86 case . in other cases\n@xmath15 symmetry is broken and one expect non - zero @xmath79 from those cases . primarily , we consider that all parameters are real .\nwe want to study the mixing pattern and want to see its deviation from tri - bi maximal pattern considering experimental value of mass squared differences of neutrinos .\nwe explore all nine cases including @xmath86 case .\nalthough @xmath86 case could not generate non - zero @xmath79 , however , we want to see whether this breaking can reduce the tri - bi maximal value of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) to its best fit value ( @xmath89 ) or not along with the special feature @xmath90 and @xmath91 . here\n, we explicitly demonstrate the procedure for a single case and for the other cases expressions for eigenvalues and mixing angles are given in apendix .\n\\(i ) breaking at 22 element : in this case , the structure of @xmath2 is given by @xmath92 and after implementation of see - saw mechanism keeping the same texture of @xmath25 , three light neutrino mass eigenvalues come out as @xmath93 and the three mixing angles come out as @xmath94\\nonumber\\\\ \\sin\\theta_{13 } & = & { \\frac{\\epsilon}{3 } } \\left({\\frac{d}{{\\sqrt 2}a } } -{\\frac{{\\sqrt 2}d}{4a -

4k-1)\\right ] } \\label{ep22 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , we have evaluated all other possible cases which we have listed in the appendix .\nplot of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath47 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values . , height=302 ]     plot of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath47 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values .\n, height=302 ]     plot of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath47 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values .\n, height=302 ]    now the @xmath108 parameter is determined in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath47 and we substitute it to the expressions for mixing angles .\nthus it is possible to explore all three mixing angles @xmath87 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 in terms of @xmath101 and @xmath47 .\nparticularly , the deviation from tri - bimaximal mixing depends only on @xmath101 and @xmath47 . for the best fit values of the solar and atmospheric\nmass squared differences ( @xmath109 ) , we have shown in fig .\n[ th12 ] , fig .\n[ th23 ] and fig .\n[ th13 ] the variations of @xmath87 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 verses @xmath47 , respectively .\nwe have studied all nine possible cases and shown in the plots .\nfirst of all , non - zero value of @xmath107 is obtained if we allow @xmath1 symmetry breaking terms explicitly in any one of the 12 , 13 , 21 , 31 , 22 , 33 element of the dirac neutrino mass matrix and those are the cases of our interest . in the present analysis\n, we have shown that non - zero @xmath107 is generated in a softly broken @xmath1 symmetric model which leads to deviation from the tri - bimaximal mixing . in @xmath1\nsymmetric model @xmath107 is zero because of residual @xmath15 symmetry in neutrino sector after spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 symmetry .\napart from the explicit breaking of @xmath1 symmetry at 11 element , @xmath15 is broken for all 12 , 13 , 21 , 31 , 22 , 33 , 23 , 32 cases .\nfurthermore , perturbation around 23 , 32 elements also lead to zero value of @xmath107 at the leading order although @xmath15 symmetry is broken , non - zero value is generated if we consider higher order terms of @xmath110 which are too tiny and hence , discarded from our analysis .\nwe include 11 case for completeness which preserves @xmath15 symmetry and hence generates @xmath111 and @xmath91 .\nit only shifts @xmath87 from the tri bimaximal value , but it can not be able to go towards the best fit value of solar angle , @xmath112 .\nif @xmath113 , then we get @xmath114 , and thereby , the value of @xmath107 is very small also @xmath87 will hit the exact tri - bimaximal value in some cases .\nthe effect of variation on the mixing angles around @xmath115 are asymmetric .\nfor some cases ( for example 23 , 32 ) @xmath106 changes very fast in the @xmath116 region .\nso , we explore the mixing angles with the range @xmath117 . we choose the most feasible cases in which perturbation is applied around 12 , 13 elements , because in those cases , variation of @xmath47 encompasses the best - fit values of @xmath87 and @xmath106 .\nalthough , in the 21 , 31 cases , the value of @xmath106 touches the best - fit value @xmath85 , however , @xmath87 far apart from the best - fit value .\nin order to achieve large @xmath107 , we have to choose the 21 , 31 cases , but we have to allow the variation of @xmath87 around as large as @xmath118 . in case of 22 , 33 , the structure of @xmath2 is still diagonal and also we can get larger @xmath107(upto @xmath119 ) and also @xmath87 is within @xmath120 , however , @xmath106 will reach @xmath121 value .    in summary , we have shown that non - zero @xmath107 is generated in a @xmath1 symmetric model which leads to deviation from the tri - bimaximal mixing through see - saw mechanism due to the incorporation of an explicit @xmath1 symmetry breaking term in @xmath2 .\nthe breaking is incorporated through a single parameter @xmath108 and we have investigated the effect of such breaking term in all nine elements of @xmath2 .\nsome of them generates still zero value of @xmath107 and rest of the others generated non - zero @xmath107 .\nwe expressed all three mixing angles in terms of one model parameter and showed the variation of all three mixing angles with the model parameter @xmath47 .\nwe find breaking through 12 and 13 elements of @xmath2 are most feasible in view of recent neutrino experimental results .\nin this section , we consider one of the parameter is complex and out of all nine cases as mentioned earlier , we investigate one suitable case arises due to 13 element perturbation .\nthis is one of the suitable positions of breaking justified from real analysis .\nagain this extension is minimal to generate non - zero cp violation because we consider only one parameter complex .\nwe take @xmath95 as complex : @xmath53 . hence ,\nthe form of @xmath2 and @xmath25 under explicit @xmath1 symmetry breaking with complex extension are : @xmath122      using the see - saw mechanism we get the light neutrino mass matrix as @xmath123 we need to diagonalize the @xmath38 to obtain the masses and mixing angles .\nthe eigenvalues are same as we have in the real case and only difference is that the @xmath95 is complex now .\nwe explicitly write down the complex phase in the mass matrix .\nthe obtained eigenvalues are : @xmath124 where we keep terms upto first order in @xmath81 . now with @xmath42 , @xmath125 and keeping term upto first order in @xmath81 we get the three neutrino mass squared as @xmath126 using those expressions we get the mass squared differences and their ratio which are , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .\n\\label{rc13 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mixing angles are obtained from diagonalisation of @xmath38 .\nwe solve the equations of the form @xmath129 . these @xmath130 will give the columns of the diagonalising unitary matrix @xmath131 . throughout our calculation\nwe assume that breaking parameter @xmath81 is small .\nwe have the nonzero @xmath132 which is proportional to @xmath81 .\nso , the values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 will give the solar and atmospheric mixing angles , respectively .\nthe expressions for the mixing angles come out as @xmath135     plot of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath136 for the breaking of @xmath1 in 13 element of @xmath2 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values.,height=302 ]    @xmath137    @xmath138^{1/2 } \\label{t13c13}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the expression of mixing angles it is clear that the deviations from tri - bi maximal are first order in @xmath81 .\nthe independent parameters in this model are @xmath96 , @xmath95 , @xmath139 , @xmath81 and @xmath136 .\nalternatively the independent parameters are @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath47 , @xmath81 and @xmath136 ( where @xmath142,@xmath125 , @xmath143 ) . in the above analysis of light neutrino mass and mixing , scale @xmath140\ndid not appear explicitly .\nwe have four well measured observable which are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath87 and @xmath106 , and , thus , in principle it is possible to determine four parameters @xmath141 , @xmath47 , @xmath81 and @xmath136 and we are able to predict the other less known observable such as angle @xmath107 , cp violating parameter @xmath144 etc .\nit is difficult to get inverse relations of those observable . from the expression of @xmath101 in eq .\n[ rc13 ] we easily obtain the expression for @xmath81 as     plot of @xmath106 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath136 for the breaking of @xmath1 in 13 element of @xmath2 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values .\n, height=302 ]     plot of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath136 for the breaking of @xmath1 in `` 13 '' element of @xmath2 .\nwe keep @xmath104 and @xmath105 to their best fit values .\n, height=302 ]    @xmath145}{4\\left[r(1+k^2 -

[ msdc13 ] we get the expression for @xmath46 : @xmath146 where @xmath81 is in the form of eq .\n[ epc13 ] .\nthus , @xmath81 and @xmath46 depend on the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath136 and experimentally known @xmath101 .\nextraction of @xmath47 and @xmath136 from other two known mixing angles is little bit difficult .\nrather we have plotted @xmath87 and @xmath106 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath136 and obtain the restriction on the parameter space of @xmath47 and @xmath136 . from the expression of @xmath147 in eq .\n[ t12c13 ] we are seeing that there is a factor @xmath59 in the denominator .\nfor @xmath116 there will be a @xmath136 for which the quantity @xmath59 becomes zero .\nhence , we should keep @xmath45 .\nagain the factor @xmath59 should be small to ensure that @xmath81 is also small .\nit justifies our whole analysis because we consider first order perturbation as we considered symmetry @xmath1 remains approximate .\nwe consider the range @xmath148 and @xmath149 . from fig .\n[ th12c13 ] we see that @xmath87 changes from the tri - bi maximal value @xmath150 to @xmath151 .\nnear @xmath152 it crosses the best fit value @xmath112 .\nwe have plotted

@xmath47 and @xmath136 .\nwe have plotted @xmath144 in fig .\n[ fjcp1 ] where the values are normalized by a factor @xmath162 . for\nthe same range of @xmath47 and @xmath136 the model predicts @xmath144 up to the order of @xmath165 which is appreciable to observe through the forthcoming experiments . inverting the expression of @xmath144 ,\nthe phase @xmath160 is extracted in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath136 and it is plotted in fig .\n[ dcp13 ] .\nwe see that the value of @xmath160 is large upto @xmath166 and , thereby , compensates small @xmath107 effect in @xmath144 and makes it observable size . one important discussion we have to make about the range of @xmath136 and @xmath47 .\none can ask why we are keeping ourselves small range of those parameters where larger @xmath136 can enhance the @xmath107 and @xmath144 .\nwe have studied that the larger value of @xmath136 and also @xmath47 in negative become responsible for breaking the analytic bound @xmath167 .\nso , we keep ourselves in shrinked parameter space which keep @xmath87 and @xmath106 in exceptionally good values according to the experiment and also can able to generate observable cp violation instead of small @xmath107 .\nanother thing we want to point out that negative value of @xmath136 equally acceptable as far as it is small .\nit could not change mixing angles because their expressions depend on @xmath136 through @xmath168 and @xmath169 . only @xmath144 and @xmath160 will change in sign which are unsettled according to the experiments .    at the end\nwe want to check whether the range of @xmath47 and @xmath136 can satisfy the double beta decay bound @xmath170 ev . in our model expression for this quantity is : @xmath171 and it will be also only function of @xmath47 and @xmath136 .\nwe plot this in fig .\n[ mee13 ] and it remains well below the experimental upper bound .\nagain we want to discuss about the mass pattern . throughout our whole analysis in real as well as complex case\nwe keep @xmath3 and @xmath4 to their best fit value and take the negative sign of @xmath4 .\nit corresponds to so called inverted ordering of neutrino mass .\nit is the feature near @xmath115 .\nit is necessary to keep @xmath172 .\nwhy we so fond of this region of @xmath47 instead of region @xmath173 which can give the normal hierarchical mass spectrum .\nthe reason is that the inverted ordering corresponds to the light neutrino mass scale @xmath174 where @xmath175 for normally ordered mass spectrum .\nso , from the point of view of observable cp violation , it is inevitable to choose larger value of @xmath141 because @xmath176 .\nso , inverted hierarchical mass spectrum compatible with the observable cp violation .\nnow we extend our study of this model to leptogenesis .\nwe want to see whether we can have appreciable leptogenesis compatible with baryon asymmetry for the same parameter space @xmath47 and @xmath136 after successful low energy data analysis for the

to describe baryon asymmetry .\nwe keep the same right handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath25 as before .\nthe change only appear in dirac type yukawa coupling and hence in @xmath2 also .\nthe diagonalisation of @xmath25 gives @xmath178 and hence the masses of the right handed neutrino are @xmath179 and the phases are @xmath180 the explicit form of diagonalising matrix is @xmath181 where

approximate symmetry .      in this model\neverything is determinable in terms of parameter @xmath47 and @xmath136 .\nwell measured quantities fix the value of those parameters .\nso , value of the rest of the physical quantities ( some of them not so well measured in experiment like @xmath107 , @xmath280 and some of them yet to measure in experiment like @xmath144 , @xmath160 and the majorana phases also ) are obtainable in this model .\nquestion may arise whether we can have any relations among the phases in this model or not .\nfirst of all , there are two kinds phases , low energy and high energy phases .\nhigh energy phases are responsible to generate the lepton asymmetry .\nthe low energy phases are responsible for determining low energy leptonic cp violation .\nlow energy phases are in two type , one is the lepton no preserving cp violating phase @xmath160 and another two are the lepton no breaking cp violating phases . in general , all phases are independent , meaning that there are no correlation among the phases between high and low energy sector , and also phases inside a particular sector are not correlated . for three generations of neutrinos , there are three key phases which are responsible for leptogenesis\n. those are phases in @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 . from matrix @xmath74 given in eq .\n( [ hc13 ] ) , we have @xmath284 it leads to the relation , @xmath285 for a given @xmath47 and @xmath136 the @xmath286 and @xmath287 are known from eq .\n( [ majp ] ) .\nhence @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 are individually determinable phases .\nbut , in this model values of those high energy phases follow the relation given in eq .\n( [ hprl ] ) .\nnow , let us give a fresh look to the leptonic mixing matrix . in eq .\n( [ mnuc ] ) we have given the tri - bimaximal rotated form of the neutrino mass matrix .\nkeeping terms upto first order in @xmath81 we obtain the diagonalising matrix in the following form , @xmath291 where the @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 and the associated phases are completely known function of @xmath47 and @xmath136 .\nan additional phase matrix @xmath295 is needed to make masses of light neutrino real , from eq .\n( [ msevc ] ) we have the phase matrix @xmath296 to obtain the ckm form of mixing matrix we need to rotate @xmath297 by two diagonal phase matrix , let @xmath298 and @xmath299 .\nso , we have @xmath300 now the with @xmath107 small we can write @xmath301 and more six relations .\nbut these three are sufficient for our discussions .\nthe phases associated to @xmath297 elements , like @xmath302 , @xmath303 , and @xmath304 associated to @xmath305 , @xmath306 and @xmath307 respectively , are completely determinable in terms of @xmath47 , @xmath136 using functional form of @xmath81 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 and their associates phases . now from the eq .\n( [ ckm ] ) we obtain the following phase relations @xmath308 now the form of total mixing matrix is , @xmath309 this phase part in the parenthesis can be absorbed to charged lepton fields and the remaining part gives the leptonic mixing matrix of the form @xmath310 , where the @xmath311 and @xmath312 are the two majorana phases of leptonic mixing matrix . from eq .\n( [ ffmv ] ) and using relations in eq .\n( [ prl1 ] ) and eq .\n( [ phh ] ) , we have the majorana phases , @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath315 are known function of @xmath47 and @xmath136 . in eq .\n( [ majp2 ] ) we have the relation of low energy and high energy phases .\nso , in our model we have correlation among the cp violating phases .\nwe have shown that non - zero @xmath0 is generated in a softly broken @xmath1 symmetric model through see - saw mechanism incorporating single parameter perturbation in @xmath2 in single element .\nfirst , we have studied all possible nine cases to explore the mixing angles considering all model parameters real . the extent of @xmath107 investigated , keeping the experimental values of present solar and atmospheric mixing angles . among all nine possible texture of @xmath2 some of them generates non - zero @xmath107 . out of those non - zero @xmath107 generating textures of @xmath2 we find that breaking at 12 and 13 elements are encompassing the best values of @xmath87 and @xmath106 . however , the reach of @xmath107 in those cases are around @xmath261 .\nconsidering one of the parameter complex we extend our analysis with one of the most suitable texture of @xmath2 with breaking at 13 element .\nwe have calculated mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences in terms four model parameters ( @xmath141 , @xmath81 , @xmath47 , @xmath136 ) .\nwe restrict model parameters utilising the well measured quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath87 and @xmath106 and we have obtained @xmath107 ( upto @xmath156 ) and large @xmath144 ( @xmath316)and @xmath317 well below the present experimental upper bound .\nin addition to that a large @xmath160 is also obtained .\nfurther study on leptogenesis is also done and the present wmap value of baryon asymmetry is obtained for a right handed neutrino mass scale @xmath8 gev . in our model , we have seen that the phases responsible for the leptogenesis are correlated .\nwe also find out the relations among low energy cp violating phases and the lepton asymmetry phases .\nsmall @xmath1 symmetry breaking parameter @xmath81 , is sufficient to describe the all low energy neutrino data and high energy cp violation ( leptogenesis ) .\nso , @xmath1 symmetry is an approximate
