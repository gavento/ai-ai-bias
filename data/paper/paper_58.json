    "article": "percolation@xcite describes the passage of an influence through a medium which is irregularly structured in the sense that the influence can propagate through some regions whereas it can not pass other areas .\nprominent examples for such media are computer networks like the internet where information propagates and irregularity can be caused by random switch failures or other technical problems .\na particularly simple percolation model is the random resistor network ( rrn ) . in this model\nthe irregular medium is given by a , say hypercubic , lattice in which bonds between nearest neighboring sites are randomly occupied with a probability @xmath4 .\nthe influence corresponds to an external current @xmath5 , which is injected at a terminal site @xmath6 and withdrawn at another terminal site @xmath7 .\ndepending on the occupation probability @xmath4 the resistors ( bonds ) are likely to either be isolated or to form clusters .\ntwo sites belong to the same cluster if they are connected by a path of bonds and hence current can flow between them . at low @xmath4 two infinitely separated terminal sites @xmath6 and\n@xmath7 are not connected by such a path and the network behaves as an insulator . for large @xmath4 , on the other hand , many paths between @xmath6 and @xmath7 may exist and the network is a conductor .\ntherefore , at some probability in between , a threshold @xmath8 must exist where for the first time current can percolate from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .\nthe threshold probability is called the percolation threshold .\nsince it separates the conducting and the insulating phase , it is also referred to as the critical probability . in rrns\nthe influence can percolate through occupied bonds in all directions .\nthe resulting clusters are typically isotropic in space .\nthis kind of percolation is referred to as isotropic percolation ( ip ) .\nthe linear extend of the isotropic clusters can be characterized by the correlation length @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the correlation length exponent of the ip universality class .\ndirected percolation ( dp)@xcite is an anisotropic variant of percolation .\nthe bonds function as diodes so that the current can percolate only along a given distinguished direction .\nthe critical properties of isotropic and directed percolation are very different .\ntypical dp clusters are anisotropic and they are characterized by two different correlation lengths : @xmath11 ( parallel to the distinguished direction ) and @xmath12 ( perpendicular to it ) . as one approaches the critical probability ,\nthe two correlation lengths diverge with the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the dp universality class .\nthe apparent success of dp might be attributed to the fact that it is perhaps the simplest model resulting in branching self - affine objects .\nit has many potential applications , including fluid flow through porous media under gravity , hopping conductivity in a strong electric field@xcite , crack propagation@xcite , and the propagation of surfaces at depinning transitions@xcite .\ndp has a dynamic interpretation in which the distinguished direction is viewed as time .\na dp cluster then represents the history of a stochastic process . in this dynamic interpretation\nthe dp universality class is the generic universality class for phase transitions from an active to an absorbing inactive state .\nfor example the epidemic spreading of an infectious desease without immunization@xcite may be described by dp@xcite .\nmoreover , dp is related to self - organized critical models  @xcite .    in the early 1980 s redner introduced the random resistor diode network ( rdn ) which comprises both , ip and dp .\na rdn is a bond percolation model where nearest - neighbor sites are connected by a resistor , a positive diode ( conducting only in the distinguished direction ) , a negative diode ( conducting only opposite to the distinguished direction ) , or an insulator with respective probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . in the three dimensional phase diagram ( pictured as a tetrahedron spanned by the four probabilities )\none finds a nonpercolating and three percolating phases .\nthe percolating phases are isotropic , positively directed , or negatively directed . between the phases there are surfaces of continuous transitions .\nall four phases meet along a multicritical line , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . on the entire multicritical line ,\ni.e. , independently of @xmath2 , one finds the scaling properties of usual isotropic percolation ( @xmath20 ) . for the crossover from ip to dp see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . in this paper\nwe focus exclusively on the vicinity of the critical surface separating the non - percolating and the positively directed phase .\nan important notion in the theory of rdn is the average resistance @xmath21 between two connected terminal sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the network .\nthe critical behavior of this average resistance is well known@xcite .\nif @xmath21 is measured for example in the distinguished , timelike direction then it scales like @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the dp resistance exponent . here in this paper\nwe consider a generalized rdn in which the resistor - like bonds and the diode - like bonds under forward bias voltage obey a generalized ohm s law , @xmath0 . our motivation to assume this non linear ohm s law is twofold .\nfirst , real circuit elements have non linear current - voltage characteristics .\nthis is obviously the case for diodes but it also applies to a certain extend to resistors , in particular for large currents .\nour main motivation is , however , that the generalized average resistance @xmath26 is related for certain values of @xmath2 to important fractal substructures of dp clusters .\nthis relation provides us with an elegant way to determine the fractal dimensions of the red bonds , the chemical path , and the dp backbone .\nparts of this work have been presented briefly in ref .\n@xcite .\nthe plan of presentation is the following . in sec .\n[ themodel ] we give background on non linear rdn and set up our field theoretic model .\nsection  [ rga ] sketches our renormalization group improved perturbation calculation .\nwe derive the scaling behavior of @xmath26 which is governed by a generalized resistance exponent @xmath1 .\nwe present our one - loop result for @xmath1 . in sec .\n[ fracdim ] we calculate the fractal dimensions of the red bonds , the chemical path , and the dp backbone by considering the limits @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively .\nsection  [ concls ] contains our conclusions .\nconsider a @xmath30-dimensional hypercubic lattice in which the direction @xmath31 is distinguished .\nassume that the bonds @xmath32 between two nearest neighboring sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 are directed so that @xmath35 .\nsuppose that the directed bonds obey the non - linear ohm s law@xcite    [ ohmr ] @xmath36 or , equivalently , @xmath37\n@xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the potential at site @xmath33 , is the voltage drop over the bond between sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 .\n@xmath40 denotes the current flowing from @xmath34 to @xmath33 . in the following\nwe drop the subscript @xmath41 whenever it is save .\nthe bond conductances @xmath42 are random variables taking on the values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 with respective probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .\n@xmath43 is a positive constant and @xmath50 denotes the heaviside function .\nthe exponents @xmath2 and @xmath51 are describing the non linearity with @xmath52 .\nthe bond resistances @xmath53 are related to the conductances via @xmath54 .\nnote that the diodes are idealized : under forward - bias voltage they behave for @xmath55 as `` ohmic '' resistors whereas they are insulating under backward - bias voltage .\nwe point out that the round brackets in eq .\n( [ ohmr ] ) contain the argument of the bond conductance or resistance , respectively .\nit is important to realize that these quantities depend on the voltages or currents by means of the step function and that @xmath56 .\nhence we may write @xmath57 and @xmath58 .\nassume that an external current @xmath5 is injected at @xmath6 and withdrawn at @xmath7 .\nit is understood that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected .\nthe power dissipated on the network is by definition @xmath59 using ohm s law it may be expressed entirely in terms of the voltages as @xmath60 the sum is taken over all bonds on the cluster connecting @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath61 denotes the corresponding set of voltages .\n@xmath62 stands for the macroscopic resistance when @xmath5 is inserted at @xmath6 and withdrawn at @xmath7 .\nsimilarly one may define @xmath63 as the macroscopic resistance when @xmath5 is inserted at @xmath7 and withdrawn at @xmath6 .\nthe two quantities are related by @xmath64 . from the power one\nobtains kirchhoff s first law @xmath65 as a consequence of the variation principle @xmath66 = 0 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the summation in eq .\n( [ kirchhoff ] ) extends over the nearest neighbors of @xmath33 and @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 .    alternatively to eq .\n( [ power1 ] ) , the power can be expressed in terms of the currents as @xmath69 with @xmath70 denoting the set of currents flowing through the individual bonds .\nit is understood that @xmath71 whenever @xmath72 .\nkirchhoff s second law , saying that the voltage drops along closed loops vanish , can be stated in terms of the variation principle@xmath73 i.e. , there are no independent loop currents @xmath74 circulating around a complete set of independent closed loops .\nnow we take a short detour and show that the average resistance @xmath26 is related for specific values of @xmath2 to the mass , i.e. , the average number of bonds , of important substructures of dp clusters .\nthe arguments below are well established for rrn and we simply adapt them here to rdn .\nwe start with the backbone .\nthe ( forward ) backbone between two sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is defined , in principle , as the union of all current carrying bonds when @xmath5 is injected at @xmath6 and withdrawn at @xmath7 .\nconsider @xmath29 .\none obtains immediately as a consequence of eq .\n( [ power2 ] ) , that @xmath75 with only those bonds carrying non zero current contributing to the sum on the right hand side .\nhence @xmath76 where @xmath77 stands for the mass of the backbone .\nnow we turn to @xmath27 and @xmath28 following the lines of blumenfeld and aharony@xcite . on the backbone between two sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 one may distinguish between two different substructures : blobs formed by multi - connected bonds and singly connected bonds which are referred to as red bonds . both substructures are contributing to the resistance of the backbone @xmath78 where the sums are taken over all bonds belonging to blobs and over all red bonds respectively . since sites on a blob\nare multi - connected by definition , @xmath79 , and thus @xmath80 in conclusion , @xmath81 is related to the mass of the red bonds @xmath82 via @xmath83    consider now the first site @xmath6 at some end of a blob .\nan entering current @xmath5 splits into currents @xmath84 flowing to nearest neighbors @xmath33 with @xmath85 in the limit @xmath86 the ratios @xmath87 vanish whenever @xmath88 .\nthus , current flows only through the resistor with the largest @xmath89 .\nthis argument may be iterated through the entire blob .\none identifies either a single self avoiding chain through which @xmath5 flows , with @xmath90 being the power dissipated on the chain , or several of such chains with identical power .\nthe expression in eq .\n( [ powerofchain ] ) is minimal for minimal @xmath91 , i.e. , the current chooses the shortest path through the blob and one is led to @xmath92 where @xmath93 stands for the mass of the chemical path .\nour aim now is to calculate the average resistance between two ports @xmath6 and @xmath7 which is precisely defined by @xmath94 @xmath95 denotes the average over all configurations of the diluted lattice .\n@xmath96 is an indicator function that takes the value one if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positively connected , i.e. , if @xmath5 can percolate from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and zero otherwise .\nnote that @xmath97 is nothing more than the usual dp correlation function .\nnow we follow an idea by stephen@xcite and its generalization to networks of nonlinear resistors by harris@xcite and exploit correlation functions @xmath98 of @xmath99 as generating functions of @xmath100 . in writing eqs .\n( [ defcorr ] ) and ( [ defpsi ] ) we switched to @xmath101-fold replicated voltages , @xmath102 , and imaginary currents , @xmath103 .\nthe correlation functions are given by @xmath104 \\bigg\\rangle_c \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the normalization @xmath107 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the additional power term @xmath108 which we have introduced in eqs .\n( [ erzeugendefunktion ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) is necessary to give the voltage integrals a well defined meaning . without this term\nthe integrands depend only on voltage differences and the integrals are divergent\n. physically the new term corresponds to grounding each lattice site by a capacitor of unit capacity .\nthe original situation can be retrieved by taking the limit of vanishing frequency , @xmath109 .    because the integrations in eqs .\n( [ erzeugendefunktion ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) are not gaussian , we employ the saddle point method .\nthe saddle point equation is nothing more than the variation principle stated in eq .\n( [ variationprinciple1 ] ) .\nthus , the maximum of the integrand is determined by the solution of the circuit equations ( [ kirchhoff ] ) .\nprovided that the condition @xmath110 holds , we obtain , up to an unimportant multiplicative constant which goes to one in the limit @xmath111 , @xmath112 \\right\\rangle_c \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 now we may expand @xmath114 about @xmath115 , @xmath116 this shows us that @xmath114 is indeed the desired generating function from which the average resistance may be calculated via @xmath117    here we would like to comment on the nature of @xmath118 .\nwe work near the limit when all the components of @xmath118 are equal and continue to large imaginary values .\naccordingly we set@xcite @xmath119 with real @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and impose the condition @xmath122 . the saddle point approximation may be justified by demanding @xmath123    substitution of eq .\n( [ crazylambda ] ) into the definition of @xmath124 leads to @xmath125 thus , one can justify the expansion in eq .\n( [ expansionofg ] ) by invoking the conditions @xmath126 note that the replica limit @xmath127 allows for a simultaneous fulfillment of the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .\nhowever , we will not only rely exclusively on these conditions on @xmath118 .\nwe will provide several consistency checks for the validity of harris saddle point approach as we go along and reproduce known results .      since infinite voltage drops between different clusters\nmay occur , it is not guaranteed that @xmath106 stays finite , i.e. , the limit @xmath128 is not well defined\n. this problem can be regularized by switching to voltage variables @xmath129 taking discrete values on a @xmath101-dimensional torus  @xcite .\nthe voltages are discretized by setting @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the gap between successive voltages , @xmath132 is a voltage cutoff , @xmath133 is a @xmath101-dimensional integer , and @xmath134 a positive integer .\nthe components of @xmath133 are restricted to @xmath135 and periodic boundary conditions are realized by equating @xmath136 .\nthe continuum may be restored by taking @xmath137 and @xmath138 . by setting @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and , respectively , @xmath141\n, the two limits can be taken simultaneously via @xmath142 .\nnote that the limit @xmath111 has to be taken before any other limit .\nsince the voltages and @xmath118 are conjugated variables , @xmath118 is affected by the discretization as well : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a @xmath101-dimensional integer taking the same values as @xmath133 .\nthis choice guarantees that the completeness and orthogonality relations    [ complete ] @xmath145 and @xmath146    do hold .\nequation  ( [ complete ] ) provides us with a fourier transform between the @xmath129- and @xmath118-tori .    after taking care of these regularization issues ,\nwe now carry out the average over the diluted lattice configurations in eq .\n( [ erzeugendefunktion ] ) .\nthis provides us with the effective hamiltonian @xmath147 \\right\\rangle_c   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\sum_{\\underline{b } } k \\left ( \\vec{\\vartheta}_{\\underline{b } }

loop diagrams by using simple rules .\nfor example , two nonlinear resistors with resistances @xmath238 and @xmath239 added in series have a total resistance @xmath240 given by @xmath241 whereas two such resistors in parallel give @xmath242 by exploiting eq .\n( [ addrule2 ] ) find @xmath243 + { \\sl o } \\left ( u^2 \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] calculating @xmath237 for general @xmath2 to higher loop orders appears to be beyond possibility .\nthe reason is , that conducting diagrams like c appear .\nthe total resistance of these diagrams can not be determined by using simple rules like eqs .\n( [ addrule1 ] ) and ( [ addrule2 ] ) .\ninstead , one has to solve the set of nonlinear circuit equations which is hardly feasible in closed form .\nnow we set up in a standard fashion the renormalization group equation for our problem .\nthe unrenormalized theory has to be independent of the length scale @xmath244 introduced by renormalization .\nin particular , the unrenormalized connected @xmath245 point correlation functions must be independent of @xmath229 , i.e. , @xmath246 for all @xmath245 .\n( [ independence ] ) translates via the wilson functions    @xmath247    where the bare quantities are kept fix while taking the derivatives , into the gell -

port resistance , we now take a closer look at the two point correlation function @xmath263 .\nequation  ( [ scaling ] ) implies for @xmath114 at @xmath264 that @xmath265 where we dropped several arguments for notational simplicity . in the following we set @xmath266 and @xmath267 , once more for the sake of simplicity .\nthe choice @xmath268 and a taylor expansion of the right hand side of eq .\n( [ scalerel ] ) lead to @xmath269 where the @xmath270 s are scaling functions .\nequally well we can choose @xmath271 which then leads to @xmath272 with other scaling functions @xmath273 and @xmath274 and where @xmath275 .\nnow we can extract the critical behavior of @xmath100 . for measurements in the distinguished direction\nwe straightforwardly exploit eq .\n( [ scalet ] ) via eq .\n( [ shit ] ) and find that @xmath276 for all other directions we determine @xmath100 from eq .\n( [ scalex ] ) . with help of eq .\n( [ shit ] ) we find that @xmath277 here it is convenient to choose a common length scale @xmath278 and to express both , @xmath279 and @xmath201 , in terms of it : @xmath280 and @xmath281 .\nthis choice guarantees that the scaling functions @xmath282 is constant and eq .\n( [ brauchnoch ] ) simplifies to @xmath283\nin this section we calculate @xmath1 for @xmath28 , @xmath27 , and @xmath29 to two - loop order .\nthis provides us with the fractal dimension of the backbone , the red bonds , and the chemical length respectively .      for self - affine\nobjects the notion of fractal dimension is less straightforward than for self - similar objects . to determine , for example , the fractal dimension of the red bonds in dp one considers a @xmath284-dimensional hyper - plane with an orientation perpendicular to @xmath285 .\nthe cut through the red bonds is a self similar object with the fractal dimension @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the local fractal dimension@xcite of the red bonds . by virtue of eqs .\n( [ massred ] ) and ( [ brauchnoch ] ) the mass of the red bonds scales as @xmath288 accordingly the mass of the cut scales like @xmath289 by choosing once more @xmath280 and @xmath290 we find that @xmath291 this leads via eq .\n( [ cutdim ] ) to @xmath292    it remains to compute @xmath293 .\nto do so we take direct advantage of our view of the feynman diagrams as being resistor networks themselves . as argued in sec .\n[ clusterproperties ] , blobs do not contribute to the total resistance for @xmath27 .\nin analogy only singly connected conducting propagators contribute to the total resistance of a diagram , i.e , @xmath294 with the sum being taken exclusively over singly connected conducting propagators .\nthe contribution of a diagram to the renormalization factor @xmath295 takes the form @xmath296 note that a factor @xmath297 in eq .\n( [ expansionofdiagrams_r_infty ] ) corresponds to the insertion ( cf .\nref.@xcite ) of @xmath298 into the @xmath33th edge of the diagram .\nthus , we can generate @xmath299 for a given conducting diagram by inserting @xmath298 into its singly connected conducting propagators .\nthis procedure is carried out up to two - loop order , i.e. , every conducting propagator in fig .\n1 that does not belong to a closed loop gets an insertion .\nthe resulting diagrams are displayed in fig .\n2 .    at this point\nit is instructive to consider the contributions of the diagrams listed in fig .  1 to @xmath232 .\nthese can be generated by inserting @xmath298 in conducting as well as in insulating propagators .\nagain , one obtains the diagrams depicted in fig .  2 with the same fore - factors .\nconsequently , @xmath295 and @xmath232 are identical at least up to two - loop order .\nthe same goes for the corresponding wilson functions @xmath300 and @xmath301 . from the definition of @xmath1 it follows that @xmath302 upon inserting eq .\n( [ resultforphiinfty ] ) into eq .\n( [ dredfoermelchen ] ) we obtain the prime result of sec .  [ redbonds ] , @xmath303 holding at least to second order in @xmath235 . by substituting the results of ref .\n@xcite in eq .\n( [ dredresult ] ) we obtain the following @xmath235-expansion for @xmath304 : @xmath305 \\ , \\epsilon   \\right\\ } + { \\sl o } \\left ( \\epsilon^3   \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the scaling relation ( [ dredresult ] ) holds rigorously and its validity is not restricted to second order in the @xmath235-expansion .\nconiglio proved for ip that the mass of the red bonds scales as @xmath306 for ip this is equivalent to saying that the fractal dimension of the red bonds is @xmath307 . since coniglio s arguments\ndo not rely on the isotropy of the system , they can be adapted to apply to dp . for the dp problem eq .\n( [ iso ] ) has to be modified to @xmath308 this in turn leads again to eq .\n( [ dredresult ] ) .\nnext we address the fractal dimension of the chemical length .\nequation  ( [ dminrel ] ) in conjunction with eq .\n( [ brauchnoch ] ) provides us with @xmath309 by applying the same reasoning as in sec .\n[ backbone ] we learn that the local fractal dimension of the chemical length is given by @xmath310    in order to calculate @xmath311 we determine the shortest self - avoiding path of conducting propagators connecting the external legs of a diagram . due to the dynamic structure\nall of these paths for a given diagram have the same total resistance that is nothing more than the total `` time '' between the external legs .\nhence , we can choose any self - avoiding path connecting the external legs .\nwe work with the diagrammatic expansion depicted in fig .  3 .\nminimal subtraction provides us with the renormalization factor @xmath312 + { \\sl o } \\left ( u^3 \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath313 as stated in eq .\n( [ renfuck ] ) is identical to the field renormalization @xmath106 given to two - loop order in refs\n.  @xcite . by virtue of the renormalization scheme ( [ renorscheme ] )\nwe deduce that @xmath314 at least to second order in @xmath315 .\nequation  ( [ trivialren ] ) leads via @xmath316 to @xmath317 from the definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath318 it follows immediately that @xmath319 in conjunction with eq  ( [ dminrel ] ) this leads finally to @xmath320 this result is intuitively plausible because the chemical distance in dp is basically equivalent to the `` time '' @xmath201 .\nwe conclude sec .\n[ fracdim ] by studying the backbone dimension . by virtue of eqs .\n( [ massbb ] ) and ( [ brauchnoch ] ) the mass of the backbone scales as @xmath321 accordingly the local fractal dimension of the backbone is given by @xmath322    it remains to compute @xmath323 .\nonce more we exploit our real - world interpretation . as argued in sec .\n[ clusterproperties ] , the resistance of the backbone between two sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given by @xmath324 with the sum running over all current carrying bonds of the underlying cluster .\nin analogy , the resistance of a conducting feynman diagram is given by @xmath325 where the sum is extending over all conducting propagators of the diagram .\nthis tells us that the contribution of a diagram to @xmath326 takes the form @xmath327 hence we can generate @xmath299 of any conducting diagram by inserting @xmath298 into its conducting propagators .\nall conducting propagators in fig .  1\nget such an insertion .\nthen it is a matter of simple counting to see that the individual contributions cancel each other .\nthus , we find @xmath328 as a consequence we obtain @xmath329 at least to second order in @xmath235 .\nequation  ( [ skalenrel ] ) leads by virtue of eq .\n( [ dbfoermelchen ] ) to @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the dp order parameter exponent known to second order in @xmath235@xcite . from the scaling relation eq .\n( [ ergebnisdb ] ) , which is the main result of this section , the @xmath235-expansion of @xmath332 is readily obtained by inserting the @xmath235-expansion for @xmath333@xcite : @xmath334 \\epsilon \\right\\ } + { \\sl o } \\left ( \\epsilon^3   \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation  ( [ ergebnisdb ] ) is in agreement with scaling arguments yielding that the fractal dimension of the transverse cut through a dp cluster with local dimension @xmath335 is @xmath336 .\nthe analogous cut through the backbone can be viewed as the intersection of the cut through the cluster and the clusters backward oriented pendant .\nhence , the codimension of the backbone cut is twice the codimension @xmath337 of the cluster cut , which leads again to eq .\n( [ ergebnisdb ] ) .\nit is interesting to compare the @xmath235-expansion result to numerical estimates .\nwe are not aware , however , of any simulations in which @xmath332 itself was determined .\net al_.   presented numerical results for the scaling exponent of the backbone mass when measured in the longitudinal direction . in the following we call this exponent @xmath338 .\nformally one can define @xmath338 via @xmath339 . from eqs .\n( [ massbb ] ) , ( [ keinelustmehr ] ) , and ( [ skalenrel ] ) it follows that @xmath340 at least to second order in @xmath235 . crudely evaluating the corresponding @xmath235-expansion of @xmath338 for small spatial dimensions leads to poor quantitative predictions .\ntherefore it is appropriate to improve the @xmath235-expansion by incorporating rigorously known features .\nwe carry out a rational approximation which takes into account that obviously @xmath341 .\npractically this is done by adding an appropriate third order term . by this procedure\nwe obtain the interpolation formula @xmath342 evaluation in two dimensions leads to @xmath343 , where the error is based on a subjective estimate .\nthis result is , within the errors , in agreement with the numerical result @xmath344 .\nour result though appears to be somewhat small .\nin this paper we studied a nonlinear version of resistor diode percolation where ohm s law is generalized to @xmath0 .\nwe investigated the critical behavior of the average two - port resistance @xmath100 at the transition from the non percolating to the directed percolating phase . by employing our real - world interpretation of feynman diagrams we calculated the resistance exponent @xmath1 for arbitrary @xmath2 to one - loop order . to our knowledge\nthis is the first time that @xmath1 has been determined for the rdn while @xmath1 is known for rrn , also to one - loop order , since the 1980s@xcite .\nextending either of these results to higher loop orders seems to be beyond possibility because not all conducting diagrams appearing at higher loop orders can be assembled by simply adding resistors in parallel and in series . for these diagrams\none has to solve the set of nonlinear kirchhoff s equations to obtain their total resistance . in closed form , however , this is hardly feasible .\nthe relation of @xmath100 to the mass of the red bonds , the chemical length , and the backbone , respectively , provided us with alternative means to extract the fractal dimensions of these substructures of dp clusters . by computing @xmath1 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 we determined @xmath304 , @xmath345 , and @xmath332 to two - loop order .\nthe fractality in dp and ip is qualitatively different .\ndp clusters are self affine rather than self similar objects . hence , the notion of fractal dimensions in more subtle for dp than for ip .\nmoreover , dp has a markovian character which is evident in the dynamic interpretation .\nthis markovian character provides for scaling relations which do not have an analog in ip . the dp backbone dimension for example\ncan be expressed entirely in terms of the usual ( purely geometric ) critical exponents of the dp universality class , @xmath346 . within the renormalization group framework\nsuch a scaling relation is typically associated with a ward identity .\nthe fact that @xmath347 renormalizes trivially to two - loop order is reminiscent of this ward identity .\nit is an interesting issue for future work to identify the ward identity and its underlying symmetry .\nanother consequence of the markovian character of dp is that the fractal dimension of the chemical length is identical to one .\nthis is intuitively plausible since the shortest longitudinal path through a dp cluster corresponds to the time in the dynamical interpretation .\nthe fractal dimension of the red bonds in dp obeys the scaling relation @xmath348 similar to the @xmath349 for ip .\nthe ward identities corresponding to either of these scaling relations are not known to date .\nagain , this leaves interesting and challenging opportunities for future studies .      for a review on percolation\nsee , e.g. , a. bunde and s. havlin , _ fractals and disordered systems _ ( springer , berlin , 1991 ) ; d. stauffer and a. aharony , _ introduction to percolation theory _\n( taylor&francis , london , 1992 ) ; b. d. hughes , _ random walks and random environments _ ( clarendon , oxford , 1995 ) . for a review on dp\nsee , e.g. , h. hinrichsen , adv . in phys . *\n49 * , 815 ( 2000 ) .\nn. van lien and b. i. shklovskii , solid state commun .  * 38 * , 99 ( 1981 ) .\nj. kertsz and t. vicsek , j.  phys .\nc * 13 * , l343 ( 1980 ) .\nsee , e.g. , a .-\nl . barabasi _\net al_. , in _ surface disordering : growth , roughening , and phase transitions _ , edited by r. jullien _\net al_.
