    "article": "in future experiments , the determination of the leptonic cp phase @xmath4 is one of the most important aim in elementary particle physics .\na lot of effort have been dedicated both from theoretical and experimental point of view in order to attain this aim , see @xcite and the references therein .\nthe cp asymmetry , @xmath9 , is widely used as the index of the cp phase dependence . here ,\n@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the oscillation probabilities for the transition @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . however , this index has to be improved on the following three points .\nthe first one is that the fake cp violation due to matter effect @xcite can not be separated clearly in @xmath14 .\nthe second one is that only the effect originated from @xmath15 is included in @xmath14 .\nthe third one is that we need to observe the channels both in neutrino and anti - neutrino for calculating @xmath14 .    in this letter\n, we introduce a new index of the cp phase dependence improved on the above three points . in arbitrary matter profile\n, we derive the maximal condition of this index exactly for @xmath12 transition .\nthis index can be extended to the case for other channels and other parameters @xcite .\nwe can simply find the situation that the cp phase effect becomes large by using this index . as an example , we demonstrate the following interesting phenomena .\nit is commonly expected that a large @xmath3 appearance signal is observed in the jparc experiment @xcite if the 1 - 3 mixing angle @xmath16 is relatively large @xmath2 and is determined by the next generation reactor experiments like the double chooz experiment @xcite and the kaska experiment @xcite . however , there is the possibility that @xmath3 appearance signal can not be observed in certain mass squared differences and mixing angles even the case for large @xmath16 .\nwe call this `` @xmath16 screening '' .\nthis occurs due to the almost complete cancellation of the large @xmath16 effect by the cp phase effect .\nif the background can be estimated precisely , we can obtain the information on the cp phase through the @xmath16 screening .\nthis means that we can not neglect the cp phase effect , which is actually neglected in many investigations as the first approximation .\nat first , we write the hamiltonian in matter @xcite as @xmath17 by factoring out the 2 - 3 mixing angle and the cp phase , where @xmath18 is the rotation matrix in the 2 - 3 generations and @xmath19 is the phase matrix defined by @xmath20 .\nthe reduced hamiltonian @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fermi constant , @xmath26 is the electron number density , @xmath27 is neutrino energy and @xmath28 is the mass of @xmath29 .\nthe oscillation probability for @xmath12 is proportional to the @xmath30 and @xmath15 in arbitrary matter profile @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath31 here @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined by parameters other than @xmath4 and are calculated by @xmath35c_{23}s_{23 } \\label{eq a } , \\\\\nb&=&2{\\rm im}[s_{\\mu e}^{\\prime * } s_{\\tau e}^{\\prime}]c_{23}s_{23 } , \\\\ c&=&|s_{\\mu e}^{\\prime}|^2c_{23}^2+|s_{\\tau e}^{\\prime}|^2s_{23}^2 \\label{eq c},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the cp dependent term and @xmath34 is the cp independent term .\nnext , let us introduce a new index of the cp phase dependence @xmath0 .\nsuppose that @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the maximal and minimal values when @xmath4 changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .\nthen , we define @xmath0 as @xmath43 namely , the new index is expressed by the ratio of the coefficient of the cp dependent term to the cp independent term .\n@xmath0 is a useful tool to explore where is the most effective region in parameter spaces to extract the cp effect from long baseline experiments although @xmath0 is not an observable .\n@xmath14 is also similar one and this is an observable .\nhowever @xmath14 have to be expressed by @xmath4 though @xmath4 is still unknown parameter so that @xmath14 seems not to be so good index to make the exploration . on the other hand , @xmath0 is calculated without using @xmath4 .\nthis is the main difference between these two indices and it is more effective to use @xmath0 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     fig.3 .\ncp dependence of @xmath3 appearance signal in the jparc - sk experiment .\nwe use the parameters as in fig.1 ( right ) except for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .\nthe condition ( [ screening - condition ] ) is satisfied in the top - left figure , and is not satisfied in other figures .\nthe statistical error is also shown within the 1-@xmath46 level .\nwe also show the value of @xmath0 calculated at @xmath47gev in figures .    as expected from the oscillation probability in fig.2 , @xmath3 appearance signal will become almost zero around @xmath48 even during the five years data acquisition in the sk experiment in the top - left of fig .\n3 . note that this occurs only when the maximal condition ( [ screening - condition ] ) is satisfied , namely @xmath1 .\nother panels in fig.3 show that the minimal value of @xmath3 appearance signal rise and is a little different from zero because ( [ screening - condition ] ) is not satisfied so precisely .\nwe obtain the similar results in the case that @xmath49 or @xmath50 changes within the allowed region obtained from solar and the kamland experiments .\nlet us here illustrate how the value of @xmath4 is constrained by the experiment .\nbelow , suppose that the atmospheric parameters have some uncertainties as @xmath51- @xmath52 and @xmath53-@xmath54 , while the solar parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath55 are fixed for simplicity .\nfor example , if 15 appearance signals are observed in the experiment , we obtain the allowed region of @xmath4 as @xmath41-@xmath56 or @xmath57-@xmath58 or @xmath59-@xmath42 from four figures in fig.3 .\nnamely , combined range of all allowed region is totally @xmath60 .\nnext , we consider the case that no appearance signal is obtained .\nthis gives the allowed region of @xmath4 as @xmath61-@xmath62 .\nnamely , combined range of all allowed region is totally @xmath56 .\nthus , we found from above rough estimation that the stronger constraint is obtained in the case of @xmath16 screening even if the uncertainties of parameters except for @xmath4 are considered .\nin other words , we can also obtain the information on the atmospheric and solar parameters .\nalthough the precise estimation of the background is a difficult problem , it is interesting to have strong constraint for not only the value of the cp phase but also other parameters like @xmath44 and @xmath45 when the @xmath3 appearance signal is not observed and the 1 - 3 mixing angle has a comparatively large value @xmath2 .\nin summary , we introduced a new index of the cp phase dependence @xmath0 and derived their maximal condition in a simple and general form . in particular\n, we showed that @xmath1 is realized in a rather wide region in the @xmath27-@xmath63 plane at certain values of parameters . in the case\nthat @xmath16 has a comparatively large value @xmath64 , ( namely @xmath16 will be observed in next generation reactor experiments ) nevertheless we can not observe @xmath3 appearance signal in the jparc experiment , we obtain the information on the cp phase as @xmath65 for @xmath66 without depending on the uncertainties of other parameters .\nalso for @xmath67 , there is a possibility that the @xmath16 screening will occur . in this case , we need to consider the reason for the absence of @xmath3 appearance signal in the jparc experiment more carefully , in order to understand whether @xmath16 is small or the @xmath16 effect is canceled out by the cp phase effect .\nwe also note that the @xmath16 screening may be realized for not only @xmath12 oscillation in super - beam experiments but also @xmath68 oscillation in neutrino factory experiments .\nwe can also use the zero probability in the @xmath16 screening to explore new physics like non - standard interaction .\nwe would like to thank prof . wilfried wunderlich ( tokai university ) for helpful comments and advice on english expressions .",
