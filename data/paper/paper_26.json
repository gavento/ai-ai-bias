    "article": "densely - grafted chains on nonadsorbing substrate surfaces form the so - called `` polymer brush''@xcite .\nthese systems find various important applications @xcite , e.g. as lubricants @xcite , for colloid stabilization @xcite , for tuning of adhesion and wetting properties @xcite , for improving the biocompatibility of drugs @xcite , as protective coatings preventing protein adsorption ( `` nonfouling '' surfaces ) in a biological milieu @xcite , microfluidic chips for biomolecule separation @xcite , etc .\nthe theoretical description of the conformations of macromolecules in these polymer brushes and their dynamics has been an active topic of research hitherto ( e.g. , @xcite ; for early reviews see @xcite\n. also the interaction of the brushes with either the solvent molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) or globular proteins @xcite and/or other nanoparticles ( e.g. , @xcite ) has found much recent attention .\nhowever , in many situations of interest there will also occur free polymer chains in the solution , interacting with the polymers of the brush .\nthis interaction has received relatively less attention , apart from the case where a polymer brush interacts with a dense polymer melt @xcite .\nthe latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interpenetration of the grafted chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush even if their chemical nature is identical ( `` wetting autophobicity '' @xcite ) .\nin contrast , scaling theory @xcite , self - consistent field @xcite and simulation @xcite have predicted partial penetration of free chains into moderately dense brushes of identical chemical nature in semi - dilute solutions when the monomer volume fraction in solution approaches that of the brush , and this behavior has been confirmed experimentally @xcite . of course , when the polymer solution is very dilute , the brush provides a free energy barrier for penetration of free chains into it and this limits the grafting density that can be achieved when one prepares a brush by grafting chains from solution @xcite ( see also some attempts to model this process by simulations @xcite ) .\nsimilarly , since typically the energy won by the chain end when it gets grafted is of the order of @xmath22 only @xcite , there is a nonzero probability that brush chains get released from the grafting substrate surface and are subsequently expelled from the brush @xcite .\nhowever , most cases studied so far refer to the situation that ( apart from chain end effects ) the chains in the bulk and those in the solution are identical .\nit is interesting , therefore , to consider the more general situation when the grafted chains and those in the bulk differ in their chemical nature .\nthen the problem of compatibility ( traditionally modelled by introducing a flory - huggins @xmath1-parameter @xcite ) between the two types of chains arises .\nthen , there is also no reason to assume that the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , and the length @xmath0 of the free chains are equal\n. such situations ( in particular , when the grafted and the free chains attract each other , @xmath24 ) are of great interest for modern applications such as protein adsorption ,  antifouling  surfaces @xcite , etc .\nhowever , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effects of the various parameters ( @xmath25 and monomer concentration of the free chains @xmath26 ) on the amount of absorption and the penetration kinetics has been reported so far .\nthe present paper presents simulation and density functional theory ( dft ) results in an effort to fill this gap . in section [ model ]\nwe describe the model and comment on some simulation aspects ; section [ theory ] summarizes our theoretical approach which includes both static and dynamic versions ( ddft ) of dft as well as self -

field approach , using eqs .\n( 12)-(17 ) from ref .  @xcite ; for the sake of brevity we do not reproduce these equations here .\nthe minimization of the grand free energy functional with respect to @xmath72 yields the equilibrium density distribution for the grafted chains which can be integrated over grafting and bonding delta - functions to obtain the following result for the density profile of the @xmath94th segment of the grafted chains:@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 , \\label{ipz}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 the two propagators in eq .\n( [ phipi ] ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99 move from the free ( @xmath100 ) and the tethered ( @xmath83 ) ends of the chain , respectively .\nthey are computed via recursive relations given by eqs .\n( 23)-(25 ) of ref .\n@xcite .\nthe normalization constant @xmath101 in eq .\n( [ phipi ] ) is chosen to ensure that the @xmath94th segment density profile is normalized to @xmath102 .\nthe total segment density profile for the grafted chains is given by : @xmath103 the equilibrium density profile for the segments of the free chains can be obtained in a similar way , by minimizing the grand free energy functional with respect to @xmath71 and integrating over bond - length constraining delta functions .\nthe dft equations described above are solved simultaneously to obtain the segment density profiles for free and grafted chains .\nthe equations are solved iteratively using picard algorithm,@xcite with the step size along the @xmath69 coordinate taken to be 0.0325 . the above procedure yields equilibrium segment density profiles for a given set of interaction potentials . in addition to the equilibrium structural properties , we have also studied the kinetics of the adsorption of free chains into the brush , following a switch of the interaction potential between free and grafted segments from repulsive to attractive .\nto this end , we have employed the ddft method , which is a dynamical generalization of the dft approach.@xcite mc simulations have indicated that the segment density profiles of the grafted chains are essentially independent of the strength of the attraction between free and grafted segments . accordingly , in our ddft calculations we take @xmath104 to be time independent and focus on the time dependence of the free chain density , @xmath105 .\nthe time evolution of the segment density profile of free chains is given by the following equation:@xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the non - equilibrium local chemical potential , and dimensionless time @xmath19 is defined according to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mobility coefficient .\ninitial density profile @xmath110 corresponds to the equilibrium distribution of free chains at a repulsive brush , i.e. @xmath30 . at @xmath111 , the brush - free polymer attraction is instantaneously `` switched on '' , i.e. we set @xmath112 .\nthe time - dependent polymer density profile is then propagated according to the eq .\n( [ phipzt ] ) , with the time - dependent chemical potential given by : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is obtained by substituting the time - dependent density @xmath105 into the expression for @xmath115 ( and likewise for the propagators @xmath116 and @xmath117 .\nwe solve eq .\n( [ phipzt ] ) using crank - nicholson scheme.@xcite note that eq .\n( [ phipzt ] ) has the form of a continuity equation with the flux ( current density ) given by @xmath118 .\nthe fact that the ddft method propagates @xmath105 via a continuity - type equation guarantees the conservation of the total number of segments in the system , which is consistent with the simulation set - up .    in order to compare the results of the ddft approach with kinetic mc data\n, we set the mobility coefficient @xmath109 equal to unity and adjust the conversion factor between ddft dimensionless time and kinetic mc number of steps for one particular set of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath26 .\ncomparisons for all other values of @xmath0 and @xmath26 are performed using the same conversion factor , while assuming @xmath109 to be inversely proportional to both @xmath0 and @xmath26 .    with the goal of shedding further light on the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the structural properties as a function of the interaction strength between the segments of the brush and the free chains ( in scft approach this interaction\nis characterized by the parameter @xmath1 which is calculated in the standard fashion from the corresponding potential well - depths : @xmath119 ) .\nthe main motivation behind carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more straightforward way to decompose the free energy into entropic and energetic components , thereby providing a complementary ( to dft ) view of the adsorption process .\nthe basic equations of the scft method are well known,@xcite and will not be reproduced here for the sake of brevity .\nonce again , the density profiles for free and grafted chains are written in terms of the propagators , the only major difference from the dft approach being that instead of the equation of state , one employs the incompressibility constraint to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively using picard s method .\nfor example , the equation for the density profile of the grafted chain segments takes the form : @xmath120 where the normalization constant @xmath121 is obtained from the grafting density @xmath102 , and @xmath122 , with @xmath123 .\nthe hard core potential @xmath124 is independent of the segment type and serves as a lagrange multiplier enforcing the incompressibility condition , meaning that the lattice space is completely filled and no segment overlap occurs .\nthe density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way .\nonce the profiles are calculated , one can easily obtain excess entropy and energy of the free chains ( relative to pure unmixed components ) as follows @xcite : @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the bulk volume fraction of free chains .\nin fig .

functions to a constant value of @xmath141 , while in the simulations the bonds are allowed to vibrate under fene potential , eq .\n( [ fene ] ) . for @xmath61 , fig .\n[ dens_nobst_fig ] shows a qualitatively similar behavior of the density profiles for the cases of gradually increasing free chain concentration ( indicated by the number of free chains @xmath142 as parameter ) .\nexpectedly , for @xmath143 ( which corresponds to monomer concentration @xmath144 ) and @xmath27 , the free chains are present in the bulk over the brush as the brush interior is then entirely filled .\nhowever , when the brush -

intuitive , as one would expect the driving force for absorption ( and , hence , the absorption rate ) to increase with increasing concentration of free chains .\na slowing down of absorption kinetics with growing size @xmath0 and concentration @xmath133 of the free chains has been experimentally observed @xcite in a porous medium ( activated carbon ) which resembles in certain aspects the polymer brush . in fig .\n[ dens_fig]b we show the variation of the absorbed amount , @xmath186 , for the critical attraction @xmath193 - see [ crit_sect ] .\nwe point out that this well pronounced power law increase of @xmath154 was observed only at this particular value of @xmath42 whereas for @xmath194 where most of our kinetic measurement were performed , no simple @xmath195 relationship was found -

the case of ( more or less ) good compatibility between species in the bulk and grafted chains .\nstarting from oligomers ( mono- and dimers ) and going up to chain lengths @xmath0 which exceed twice the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , we have determined the conformation of the absorbed species , the absorbed amount @xmath154 , and absorption kinetics ( the propagation rate into the polymer brush ) at different concentration of the free chains for two cases of moderately to very dense polymer brushes .\nin addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations , we have substantially broadened the range of lengths of the grafted chains to @xmath13 in order to test more comprehensively our findings .\nthe most salient , and - to some extent - unexpected features of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush that we find are :    * the dramatic increase in adsorbed amount @xmath7 with _ growing _ chain length @xmath0 , and * the significant slowdown of absorption kinetics with growing concentration ( i.e. , with the increase of the starting gradient in density ) of the free chains    besides these static and dynamic properties of polymer absorption in brushes , we find that both the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself largely retain their structure and conformation , as seen in quantities like @xmath203 and the monomer density profile @xmath104 , for different length @xmath0 and concentration @xmath26 of the free chains , and different strength @xmath42 of attraction to the grafted chains .\nin particular , the degree to which the brush profile @xmath104 is affected by absorption is found to be much less that anticipated in some earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .\nnontheless , even within these small changes we observe a slight contraction of @xmath104 at small absorbed amounts @xmath154 while @xmath104 gradually attains its extension roughly to that corresponding to zero concentration of free chains with growing @xmath154 .\nan interesting finding which still needs deeper understanding is the observed existence of a critical compatibility @xmath204 ( i.e. , brush - oligomer attraction @xmath205 ) . at @xmath206 we find both in mc as well as in dft / scft that the energy of all absorbed species has a value independent of their size @xmath0 whereas their entropy experiences a minimum .\nthe critical attraction @xmath205 is manifested by the existence of unique distance from the grafting plane where all monomer density profiles of the free chains intersect . moreover , at @xmath205 the kinetics of free chain absorption into the brush follows a clear cut power law with exponent @xmath207 .\nundoubtedly , much more work is needed until all these fascinating new features are fully understood .\nlast not least , we emphasize the finding of three distinct regimes in the kinetics of free chain absorption as far as the size of the free chains @xmath0 is concerned . in the first regime\nthe characteristic time for absorption @xmath19 grows rapidly with oligomer length @xmath0 as long as the oligomer size @xmath208 remains smaller than the separation between grafting sites .\nthe second regime is marked by a slower increase of @xmath19 with @xmath0 and ends roughly at @xmath209 .\nthe third regime of absorption kinetics holds for @xmath180 ( i.e. , the penetrating free chain can not accommodate within the brush ) and is characterized by a nearly constant @xmath19 as far as length @xmath0 is concerned .\ninterestingly , this rich kinetic behavior has been experimentally observed in absorption in porous media @xcite .\none of us , ( a. m. ) , acknowledges support under grant no . bi314/22 .\nanother , ( s. a. e. ) , acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt foundation , germany .\ns. alexander , j. physique ( paris ) * 38 * , 983 ( 1977 ) .\ng . de gennes , macromolecules , * 13 * , 1069 ( 1980 ) .\na. m. skvortsov , a. a. gorbunov , i. v. pavlushkov , e. b. zhulina , o. v. borisov , and v. a. pryamitzyn , polym .\n30 * , 1706 ( 1988 ) .\nt. cosgrove , t. heath , b. van lahr , f. leermakers , and j. m. h. scheutjens , macromolecules * 20 * , 1692 ( 1988 ) .\ns. t. milner , t. a. witten , and m. e. cates , macromolecules * 21 * , 2610 ( 1988 ) .\nm. muthukumar and j. s. ho , macromolecules * 22 * , 965 ( 1989 ) . m. murat and g. s. grest , macromolecules * 22 * , 4054 ( 1989 ) .\np. y. lai and k. binder , j. chem .\nphys . * 95 * , 9288 ( 1991 ) .\ns. t. milner , science * 251 * , 905 ( 1991 ) .\na. halperin , m. tirrell , and t. p. lodge , adv .\nsci . * 100 * , 33 ( 1992 ) .\ni. szleifer and m. a. carignano , adv .\nchem . phys . * 94 * , 165 ( 1996 ) .\nj. klein , ann .\n* 26 * , 581 ( 1996 ) .\ng. s. grest and m. murat , in _\nmonte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations in polymer science _\nk. binder , oxford univ .\npress , new york , 1995 , pp .\n476 -
