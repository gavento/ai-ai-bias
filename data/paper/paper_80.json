rays to be achiral ( corollary  [ chiral_cor ] ) .\nwhile most turn out to be chiral , we give a countably infinite family of pairwise inequivalent , achiral borromean rays .\n+ the notion of an _

@xmath19 is not a trivial block ( see section  [ equiv_rel_blocks ] ) . our proof that @xmath19 is irreducible ( see section  [ ab_irred ] ) makes essential use of the immersion @xmath35 in figure  [

each @xmath83 . on the other hand , it is not clear how one can use it to distinguish between two wild @xmath27-frames . in section  [ irred_blocks ] , we use irreducibility of trivial blocks to prove

multirays in @xmath0 to results on knotted multiple hyperplanes in @xmath0 . by mcpherson  @xcite\n, there exist uncountably many knot types of a ray : so there exist uncountably many knot types of a hyperplane . by fox and harrold\n@xcite , there exist uncountably many knot types of two component multirays with unknotted components ( see fox and artin  @xcite for a nice example ) : so there exist uncountably many knot types of two component multiple hyperplanes with unknotted components . + proposition  [ rays_planes ] is proved via ambient isotopies , so it also yields results on chirality .\nlet @xmath898 be a multiple hyperplane .\nwe say @xmath751 is * achiral * provided there is a diffeomorphism @xmath899 that reverses orientation of @xmath0 .\notherwise , @xmath751 is * chiral*. for example , it is an exercise to show that each unknotted multiple hyperplane @xmath760 is achiral .\n+ a multiple hyperplane @xmath751 in @xmath0 forms * borromean hyperplanes * provided @xmath751 is knotted , but any two components of @xmath751 form an unknotted multiple hyperplane .\nproposition  [ rays_planes ] implies that if @xmath30 forms borromean rays , then @xmath776 forms borromean hyperplanes .\nthus , we obtain our second main result .\nthere exist uncountably many borromean hyperplanes , pairwise distinct up to diffeomorphism of @xmath0 .\nthere exists a countably infinite family of achiral borromean hyperplanes , pairwise distinct up to diffeomorphism of @xmath0 .\ncalcut , h.c .  king , and l.c .\nsiebenmann , _ connected sum at infinity and cantrell - stallings
