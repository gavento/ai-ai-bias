linear effects .\nthe fluctuation parameter @xmath27 in eq .\n( [ eq : c_q_mv ] ) is of order k ~(n_c^2 - 1 ) q_s^2 s _  .\nonce again , the precise numerical prefactor ( in the classical approximation ) has been determined by a numerical computation to all orders in the valence charge density @xmath20  @xcite .\nthe multiplicity distribution is therefore a negative binomial distribution ( nbd )  @xcite , [ eq : nbd ] p(n ) =  .\nindeed , multiplicity distributions observed in high -

gluon multiplicity : [ eq : dn2_k ] _ conn .\n=  . from this expression\nit is straightforward to see that the perturbative expansion of @xmath28 starts at @xmath30 since the connected diagrams on the lhs of eq .\n( [ eq : dn2_k ] ) involve the same number of sources and vertices as the disconnected diagrams on the rhs of that equation ( also see appendix ) .\nthis observation is important since _ in general _ the nbd  ( [ eq : nbd ] ) exhibits kno scaling only when @xmath29 , and if @xmath27 is not strongly energy dependent .\na numerical analysis of the multiplicity distribution at 2360  gev , for example , achieves a good fit to the data for @xmath31  @xcite , which we confirm below .\nsuch values for @xmath9 have also been found for peripheral collisions of heavy ions from ab initio solutions of the classical yang - mills equations  @xcite ; furthermore those solutions predict that @xmath32 for central collisions of @xmath33 nuclei .    to illustrate how deviations from kno scaling arise it is instructive to consider a `` deformed '' theory with an additional contribution to the quadratic action .\nwe shall add a quartic operator  @xcite , s_q [ ] = d^2v_^_- dv_1 ^ - \\ { + ^_-dv_2 ^ - }  .\n[ eq : squartic ] we assume that the contribution from the quartic operator is a small perturbation since @xmath34 while @xmath35 . in the classical approximation the mean multiplicity is unaffected by the correction as it involves only two - point functions in the theories  ( [ eq : s_mv ] ) and  ( [ eq : squartic ] ) need to be matched .\nthus , the `` bare '' parameters @xmath36 in  ( [ eq : s_mv ] ) and @xmath37 in  ( [ eq : squartic ] ) are _ different _ as the latter absorbs some self - energy corrections .\nwe refer to ref .\n@xcite for details . ] . on the other hand , @xmath28 as defined in  ( [ eq : dn2_k ] ) now becomes [ eq : k_quartic ] q_s^2 s _ & = & 1 - 3 ( n_c^2 + 1 )  (   ^2 )  .     in nsd collisions at various energies and\nnbd fits ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 .\nnote that the mean multiplicity quoted for the fits has been rescaled by 1.5 to include neutral particles ; also , that here @xmath27 is integrated over the transverse plane of the collision.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]   in nsd collisions at various energies and nbd fits ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 .\nnote that the mean multiplicity quoted for the fits has been rescaled by 1.5 to include neutral particles ; also , that here @xmath27 is integrated over the transverse plane of the collision.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    therefore , in the classical approximation [ eq : quartic_nbar_k ] ~ ( 1 - 3 ( n_c^2 + 1 ) )  .\nthis result illustrates that @xmath9 decreases as the contribution of the @xmath40 operator increases .\nwe repeat that the derivation assumed that the correction is small so that  ( [ eq : quartic_nbar_k ] ) does not apply for large values of @xmath41 .    ref .\n@xcite estimated by entirely different considerations that for protons @xmath42 at @xmath43 . that would correspond to a smaller value of @xmath9 by a factor of 1.43 than for the gaussian theory .\nassuming that rg flow with energy approaches a gaussian action  @xcite , @xmath9 should increase by about this factor .\nnbd fits to the data shown in fig .\n[ fig : knofits ] confirm that @xmath9 indeed increases with energy , which might indicate flow towards a gaussian action ; however , the observed increase from @xmath44  gev to 7  tev is much stronger : a factor of about 3 .\nthis apparent discrepancy could be resolved at least partially by running of the coupling in eqs .\n( [ eq : nbar],[eq : quartic_nbar_k ] ) with @xmath5 but this requires more careful analysis at the effective scale @xmath5 is taken into account if the mean multiplicity is computed with energy evolved unintegrated gluon distributions like e.g.  in refs .\n@xcite . ] .\nin the previous section we considered the multiplicity distribution of `` produced gluons '' in a collision of classical ym fields sourced by classical color charges @xmath20 moving on the light - cone . at high energies though ( i.e. , when @xmath45 ) the classical fields are modified by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .\nresummation of boost - invariant quantum fluctuations leads to an energy dependent saturation scale , for example , as required in order to reproduce the growth of the multiplicity @xmath46 with energy .\nin particular , the energy dependence of the _ mean _ saturation scale , averaged over all `` evolution ladders '' ( distribution of quantum emissions ) , can be obtained by solving the running - coupling bk equation  @xcite .    instead ,\nin this section we shall solve a _\nevolution equation which accounts both for saturation ( non - linear ) effects as well as for the fluctuations of the rapidities and transverse momenta of the virtual gluons in the wave function of a hadron before the collision .\nwe do this in order to determine the multiplicity distribution ( rather than just the mean number ) of dipoles in a hadronic wave function boosted to rapidity @xmath47 .\nwe shall do so by solving via monte - carlo techniques the following evolution equation for @xmath48 $ ] , which is the probability for the dipole size distribution @xmath49 to occur : [ eq : plevol ] = _ z f_z[n(x)-_xz]p[n(x)-_xz , y ] -_z f_z[n(x)]p[n(x),y ]  .\nnote that in this section @xmath50 denotes the logarithmic dipole size ( conjugate to its transverse momentum ) rather than to a light - cone momentum fraction .\nthis equation has been studied before in ref .\n@xcite for fixed @xmath51 and in ref .\n@xcite for running @xmath52 .\nthose papers also provide references to related earlier work .    the first term in  ( [ eq : plevol ] )\nis a gain term due to dipole splitting while the second term corresponds to loss due to `` recombination '' .\nf_z[n(x ) ] = is the splitting rate and t_z[n(x ) ] = 1 -

y| ) ( r^2 _ < ) ( r^2 _ > ) is the elementary dipole - dipole scattering amplitude at lo in perturbative qcd . for more details\nwe refer to ref .\n@xcite . here\n, we recall only that it was found there that evolution with a running coupling suppresses fluctuations in the tails of the travelling waves and so restores approximate geometric scaling  @xcite .    we have determined the multiplicity distribution of dipoles with size @xmath55 , n_i(y ) = _\n1/q_s^2(y ) dx   n_i(x , y ) ( i=110 ^ 5 ) by evolving a given initial configuration @xmath56 @xmath57 times . despite starting with a fixed initial condition\n, evolution introduces fluctuations in the rapidities where splittings occur , and in the sizes of the emerging dipoles .     in the wave function .\nleft : evolution with trivial @xmath1-function , @xmath58const .\nright : qcd @xmath1-function.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]   in the wave function . left : evolution with trivial @xmath1-function , @xmath58const .\nright : qcd @xmath1-function.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in fig .\n[ fig : pl_kno ] we show that fixed - coupling evolution does not obey kno scaling of the distribution of virtual quanta while running - coupling evolution does .\nthe shape of the distribution however looks different than the measured distribution of produced particles from fig .\n[ fig : kno_lhcdata ] .\nthis could be due to the fact that our evolution model does not treat diffusion in impact parameter space .\nhence , @xmath59 shown in fig .\n[ fig : pl_kno ] should be interpreted as the multiplicity distribution at the center of the hadron .\nour work is supported by the doe office of nuclear physics through grant no .\nde - fg02 - 09er41620 and by the city university of new york through the psc - cuny research award program , grant 65041 - 0043 .\nwe can obtain the fluctuation parameter @xmath27 by calculating the inclusive double gluon multiplicity and expressing it in terms of the single inclusive or mean multiplicity . the connected two particle production cross section for gluons with rapidity @xmath61 and @xmath62 has the form : n_2(p , q ) -

point functions gives nine terms , one of which @xmath66 corresponds to a disconnected contribution .\nit exactly cancels the second term in eq .\n( [ eq : c_2 ] ) .\nfour of the other eight terms @xmath67 or @xmath68 give identical leading contributions to double gluon production .\nthey correspond to a `` rainbow '' diagram like the one shown in fig .\n[ fig : gaussianconn ] . in the `` rainbow '' diagram , on one side ( target or projectile ) ,\nthe @xmath20 s corresponding to the same gluon momentum are contracted with each other .\nthe remaining four `` non - rainbow '' diagrams are suppressed relative to the terms we keep at large @xmath69 and @xmath23  @xcite .\nhence , the leading gaussian contribution is : ~^4  .\n[ eq : gaussianconn ] the same reasoning applies also for the additional quartic contribution and only `` rainbow '' diagrams are considered , like the one in fig .\n[ fig : quarticconn ] .\nthere are two of them ( one for the projectile and one for the target ) to first order in @xmath70 , and their contribution is : ~-f_gaaf_gbbf_gccf_gdd _ i=1 ^ 4 + ^2 ^2 ^ac^bd(k_1-k_2)(k_3-k_4 ) + ( ^ab^cd + ^ac^bd + ^ad^bc)(k_1+k_3-k_2-k_4 )  .\nthe color factor evaluates to f_gaaf_gbbf_gccf_gdd ^ac^bd ( ^ab^cd+^ac^bd+ ^ad^bc)=2 n_c^2(n_c^2 -

( [ eq : lipatovvertex ] ) we get : -^2 ^2 +  .\nthe integral over the ladder momentum is again cut off at the saturation scale @xmath5 :  .\nthen , the quartic contribution to connected two gluon production becomes - ^2 ^2  .\n[ eq : quarticconn ] the last step is to express the fully connected diagrams in terms of the single inclusive cross section : = ^2 n_c(n_c^2 - 1 )  . [ eq : single ] summing eq .\n( [ eq : gaussianconn ] ) and eq .\n( [ eq : quarticconn ] ) and using eq .\n( [ eq : single ] ) we get : _\nthe fluctuation parameter @xmath28 is now identified with the expression in the square brackets .\nwe rewrite it in terms of [ eq : beta ] ^2  , and use [ eq : qs ] q_s^2=dz^- ^2(z^- )  , to arrive at the final expression [ eq:1/k ] q_s^2s _ = 1 - 3(n_c^2 + 1 )  .\nin this section we are going to calculate the connected diagrams for three - gluon production to obtain the correction to the reduced moment @xmath71 at order @xmath72 $ ] , assuming as before that @xmath73 . at the end of this section\nwe also outline corrections suppressed by higher powers of @xmath74 .\nwe are looking for the contribution of the connected diagrams to the following expression  @xcite : = f_gaaf_gbbf_gccf_gfff_geef_gdd   + _\ni=1 ^ 6 + _ 1^*f(p - k_2 ) _ 1^*e(q - k_4 ) _ 1^*d(l - k_6 ) _ 1^a(p - k_1)_1^b(q - k_3 ) _ 1^c(l - k_5 ) + _ 2^*f(k_2 ) _\n2^*e(k_4 ) _ 2^*d(k_6 ) _\n2^a(k_1)_2^b(k_3 ) _\n2^c(k_5 )  .\n[ eq : c3 ] as before , the @xmath20 correlators of the target and the projectile consist of two parts , one from the quadratic operator in the action and another from the additional @xmath75 operator : ^*f ^*e ^*d ^a^b ^c = ^*f ^*e ^*d ^a^b ^c _ + ^*f ^*e ^*d ^a ^b ^c _\n. the product of the two gaussian contributions from the target and the projectile , to leading order in the gluon momenta , gives rise to 16 `` rainbow '' diagrams .\nthe result has been obtained previously  @xcite and reads ( expressed in terms of the mean multiplicity ) : _\n[ eq : gaussian3gluon ] the correction , to first order in @xmath70 is ~2 ^*f ^*e\n^*d ^a^b ^c _  ^*f ^*e ^*d ^a ^b ^c _  . [ eq : simcorr ] again , we are considering only rainbow diagrams , so for the gaussian six - point function in the above expression , from all possible contractions , we keep only the term ( 2)^6 ^3 ^af^be^cd(k_1-k_2)(k_3-k_4)(k_5-k_6 )  . to calculate the correction to the six - point function to first order in @xmath70\nwe factorize it into a product of two- and four - point functions .\nthere are fifteen possible factorizations of that kind .\nthree of them are disconnected diagrams and the remaining twelve give identical contributions .\nwe consider , for example , the following combination : _ 1^*f(p - k_2 ) _ 1^*e(q - k_4 ) _ 1^*d(l - k_6 ) _ 1^a(p - k_1)_1^b(q - k_3 ) _ 1^c(l - k_5 )   + = _ 1^a(p - k_1)_1^b(q - k_3 ) _ 1^*f(p - k_2 ) _ 1^*e(q - k_4 ) _ 1^*d(l - k_6 ) _ 1^c(l - k_5 )  .\nthe two point function is _ 1^a(p - k_1)_1^b(q - k_3 ) = ( 2)^2 ^ab ( p+q - k_1-k_3 )  , and for the correction to the four - point function we use the last line from eq .\n( [ eq:4ptcorr ] ) .\nthe color factor is f_gaaf_gbbf_gccf_gfff_geef_gdd^ab(^cd^ef + ^ce^df + ^cf^de ) ^af^be^cd + = 2n_c^3(n_c^2 - 1)+n_c^3(n_c^2 - 1)^2  .\nputting everything together into eq .\n( [ eq : c3 ] ) and multiplying by two [ because of ( [ eq : simcorr ] ) ] and by twelve ( which is the number of possible diagrams ) we get : _ = ^4 ^ 2 + _\ni=1 ^ 6   + ( k_1-k_2)(k_3-k_4)(k_5-k_6)(p+q - k_1-k_3)(p+q - k_2-k_4-k_6+k_5 ) +   + = -^4 ^ 2 +  .\nagain , we regularize the ladder integrals at the saturation scale ,  .\nfinally , using expression ( [ eq : single ] ) for the mean multiplicity the @xmath75 contribution to three - gluon production becomes _ = -  .
