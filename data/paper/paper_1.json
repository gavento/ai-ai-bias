    "article": "in this paper , all graphs considered are finite , simple and undirected .\nwe use @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath2 to denote the vertex set , the edge set , the minimum degree and the maximum degree of a graph @xmath1 , respectively . denote @xmath8 and @xmath9 .\nlet @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 for simple ) denote the degree of vertex @xmath12 .\na @xmath13- , @xmath14- and @xmath15-@xmath16 is a vertex of degree @xmath13 , at least @xmath13 and at most @xmath13 , respectively .\nany undefined notation follows that of bondy and murty @xcite .\na graph @xmath1 is @xmath0-immersed into a surface if it can be drawn on the surface so that each edge is crossed by at most one other edge . in particular ,\na graph is @xmath0-planar if it is @xmath0-immersed into the plane ( i.e. has a plane @xmath0-immersion ) .\nthe notion of @xmath0-planar - graph was introduced by ringel @xcite in the connection with problem of the simultaneous coloring of adjacent / incidence of vertices and faces of plane graphs .\nringel conjectured that each @xmath0-planar graph is @xmath17-vertex colorable , which was confirmed by borodin @xcite .\nrecently , albertson and mohar @xcite investigated the list vertex coloring of graphs which can be @xmath0-immersed into a surface with positive genus .\nborodin , et al .\n@xcite considered the acyclic vertex coloring of @xmath0-planar graphs and proved that each @xmath0-planar graph is acyclically @xmath18-vertex colorable .\nthe structure of @xmath0-planar graphs was studied in @xcite by fabrici and madaras .\nthey showed that the number of edges in a @xmath0-planar graph @xmath1 is bounded by @xmath19 .\nthis implies every @xmath0-planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most @xmath20 .\nfurthermore , the bound @xmath20 is the best possible because of the existence of a @xmath20-regular @xmath0-planar graph ( see fig.1 in @xcite ) . in the same paper\n, they also derived the analogy of kotzig theorem on light edges ; it was proved that each @xmath21-connected @xmath0-planar graph @xmath1 contains an edge such that its endvertices are of degree at most @xmath18 in @xmath1 ; the bound @xmath18 is the best possible .\nthe aim of this paper is to exhibit a detailed structure of @xmath0-planar graphs which generalizes the result that every @xmath0-planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most @xmath20 in section 2 . by using this structure , we answer two questions on light graphs posed by fabrici and madaras @xcite in section 3 and give a linear upper bound of acyclic edge chromatic number of @xmath0-planar graphs in section 4 .\nto begin with , we introduce some basic definitions . let @xmath1 be a @xmath0-planar graph . in the following , we always assume @xmath1 has been drawn on a plane so that every edge is crossed by at most one another edge and the number of crossings is as small as possible ( such a dawning is called to be @xmath22 ) .\nso for each pair of edges @xmath23 that cross each other at a crossing point @xmath24 , their end vertices are pairwise distinct .\nlet @xmath25 be the set of all crossing points and let @xmath26 be the non - crossed edges in @xmath1 .\nthen the @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 of @xmath1 is the plane graph such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .\nthus the crossing points in @xmath1 become the real vertices in @xmath30 all having degree four .\nfor convenience , we still call the new vertices in @xmath30 crossing vertices and use the notion @xmath33 to denote the set of crossing vertices in @xmath30 .\na simple graph @xmath1 is @xmath34 if every cycle of length @xmath35 has an edge joining two nonadjacent vertices of the cycle .\nwe say @xmath36 is a @xmath37 @xmath38 of a @xmath0-planar graph @xmath1 if @xmath36 is obtained from @xmath1 by the following operations .\n* step 1*. for each pair of edges\n@xmath39 that cross each other at a point @xmath40 , add edges @xmath41 and @xmath42 `` close to @xmath40 '' , i.e. so that they form triangles @xmath43 and @xmath44 with empty interiors .    *\nstep 2*. delete all multiple edges .    *\nstep 3*. if there are two edges that cross each other then delete one of them .    *\nstep 4*. triangulate the planar graph obtained after the operation in step 3 in any way .    *\nstep 5*. add back the edges deleted in step 3 .\nnote that the associated planar graph @xmath45 of @xmath36 is a special triangulation of @xmath30 such that each crossing vertex remains to be of degree four . also ,\neach vertex @xmath46 in @xmath45 is incident with just @xmath47 @xmath21-faces .\ndenote @xmath48 to be the neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath45 ( in a cyclic order ) and use the notations @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is taken modulo @xmath53 .    in the following , we use @xmath54 to denote the number of crossing vertices which are adjacent to @xmath46 in @xmath45 .\nthen we have the following observations .\nsince their proofs of them are trivial , we omit them here .\nin particular , the second observation uses the facts that @xmath36 admits no multiple edge and the drawing of @xmath36 minimizes the number of crossing .\n[ obs ] for a canonical triangulation @xmath36 of a @xmath0-planar simple graph @xmath1 , we have    \\(1 ) any two crossing vertices are not adjacent in @xmath45 .\n\\(2 ) if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .\n\\(3 ) if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 .\n\\(4 ) if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 .\nlet @xmath61 and @xmath62 be a crossing vertex in @xmath45 such that @xmath63 . then by the definitions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 .\nfurthermore , the path @xmath67 in @xmath45 corresponds to the original edge @xmath68 with a crossing point @xmath62 in @xmath36 .\nlet @xmath69 be the neighbor of @xmath46 in @xmath36 so that @xmath70 crosses @xmath68 at @xmath62 in @xmath36 . by the definition of @xmath45 , we have @xmath71 .\nwe call @xmath69 the @xmath72-@xmath73 of @xmath46 in @xmath36 and @xmath74 the @xmath75-@xmath76 of @xmath46 in @xmath36 . other neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath36\nare called @xmath77-@xmath76 .\nsometimes when we say mirror vertex , image vertex and normal vertex , we refer to mirror neighbor , image neighbor and normal neighbor of @xmath46 .\nthe triangle @xmath78 in @xmath36 is called the @xmath72-@xmath79 incident with @xmath46 . since the neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath45 can be listed in a cyclic order , via replacing the crossing vertex by the mirror vertex incident with it , the neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath36\ncan be also listed in a cyclic order .\nnote that different crossing vertices are adjacent to different mirror vertices since multiple edges are forbidden in @xmath1 .\nlet @xmath80 be the neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath36 in a cyclic order .\nwe define @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath52 is taken modulo @xmath84 . note that @xmath36 is a canonical triangulation of @xmath1 .\nthen @xmath85 is a cycle which is called the @xmath27 @xmath86 of @xmath46 , denoted by @xmath87 .\nwe call the path @xmath88 a @xmath89 of @xmath87 if ( a ) the elements of @xmath90 are image neighbors of @xmath46 ; ( b ) the elements of @xmath91 are mirror neighbors of @xmath46 ; ( c ) the triangles in @xmath36 of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 are mirror triangles incident with @xmath46 and ( d ) @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not mirror neighbors of @xmath46 .\nthen @xmath96 of a segment @xmath97 is defined to be the number of mirror triangles incident with @xmath46 using vertices in @xmath98 , denoted by @xmath99 .\nthen we easily have @xmath100 .\nof a 1-planar graph @xmath1,title=\"fig:\",width=604,height=207 ] +    now we show the main result in this section .    [ structure ]\nlet @xmath1 be a @xmath0-planar simple graph .\nthen there exists a vertex @xmath46 in @xmath1 with exactly @xmath13 neighbors @xmath101 satisfying @xmath102 such that one of the following is true .\n( @xmath1031 ) @xmath104 ,    ( @xmath1032 ) @xmath105 with @xmath106 ,    ( @xmath1033 ) @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,    ( @xmath1034 ) @xmath110 with @xmath111 ,

@xmath124 .\nthe theorem is proved by contradiction .\nlet @xmath1 be a simple @xmath0-planar graph with a fixed embedding in the plane , and suppose @xmath1 is a counterexample to the theorem .\nnote that if we add a new edge @xmath125 between two nonadjacent vertices in @xmath1 so that @xmath126 is still 1-planar graph , then @xmath126 shall also be a counterexample to the theorem .\nhence in the following , without loss of generality , we always assume @xmath1 is 2-connected and @xmath127 , where @xmath36 is a canonical triangulation of @xmath1 that has been draw on a plane properly . in other words , @xmath1 is just a canonical triangulation of itself .\nso in the next , there is no necessity to distinguish the two notions @xmath1 and @xmath36 , and when we say @xmath30 , we also refer to @xmath45 . on the other hand , by the definition of associated plane graph\n, one can observe that @xmath128 when @xmath46 is not a crossing vertex .\nso in the detail proof below , we either need not to distinguish @xmath129 and @xmath10 when @xmath46 is a vertex of @xmath1 , in which case we only use the notation @xmath11 to represent both @xmath129 and @xmath10 .    for a fixed vertex @xmath46 of @xmath1 , we define @xmath130 ( @xmath131 in short ) to be the number of neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath1 which are of degree @xmath52 . for a vertex set @xmath132 , let @xmath133 .\ndenote @xmath134 and @xmath135 . for a subgraph @xmath136 of @xmath1\n, @xmath137 represents the number of @xmath52-vertices contained in @xmath136 .\nlet @xmath87 be the associated cycle of @xmath46 .\nsuppose @xmath87 has @xmath138 segments , denoted by @xmath139 ( in this cyclic order ) .\ndenote @xmath140 .\nlet @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) .\nwe call the vertex set @xmath143 the @xmath144 of the associated cycle @xmath87 . for each segment @xmath97 , we define a graph @xmath145 so that @xmath146 and @xmath147\n. let @xmath148 . by the definition of @xmath97\n, we have @xmath149 .\n( see fig .\n[ cal ] ) .\na triangle @xmath150 in @xmath1 is @xmath151 if @xmath152 .\notherwise we say that @xmath150 is @xmath153 .\nnote that for the vertex @xmath46 described above , there are @xmath154 mirror triangles incident with it ( recall the definition of the parameter @xmath154 ) . now , suppose @xmath155 of them are heavy and @xmath156 of them are light .\nwe divide all the light mirror triangles incident with @xmath46 into three classes .\nclass slowromancap1@. triangles in the form @xmath150 such that @xmath157 is mirror vertex and @xmath158 are image vertices with @xmath159 and @xmath160 .\nclass slowromancap2@. triangles in the form @xmath150 such that @xmath157 is mirror vertex and @xmath158 are image vertices with @xmath161 .\nclass slowromancap3@. triangles in the form @xmath150 such that @xmath162 .    denote the number of triangles belonging to class slowromancap1@ , slowromancap2@ and slowromancap3@ by @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 .\n* claim 1*. @xmath167 .\nsince each heavy mirror triangle incident with @xmath46 covers at least one @xmath168-vertex , there are at least @xmath169 @xmath168-vertices contained in heavy mirror triangles . and\nthis lower bound is reachable only if each heavy mirror triangle covers exactly one @xmath168-vertex such that each pair of incident mirror triangles share one common @xmath168-vertex .    for each class slowromancap2@ light mirror triangle @xmath150 such that @xmath157 is mirror vertex and @xmath158 are image vertices with @xmath170 , since ( @xmath1031)-(@xmath1034 ) are forbidden in @xmath1 , we have @xmath171 and another three neighbors of @xmath172 are all @xmath173-vertices .\nlet @xmath87 be the associated cycle of @xmath46 . then @xmath174 .\nif @xmath175 , let @xmath176 . then @xmath177 is a normal vertex\n. so @xmath177 could be incident with at most two image vertices of degree no more than five . if @xmath178 , let @xmath179 .\nthen @xmath180 is a heavy mirror triangle with two @xmath168-vertices . in either case , we would account at least @xmath181 new @xmath168-vertices which are not counted in the above step .\nhence , we have @xmath182 .    *\nclaim 2*. there is an integer @xmath183 such that @xmath184 .\nsince each class slowromancap1@ light mirror triangle contains two vertices either of degree @xmath17 or of degree @xmath20 and each class slowromancap3@ light mirror triangle contains three vertices either of degree @xmath17 or of degree @xmath20 , we deduce that @xmath185 .\n* claim 3*. @xmath186 .\nsince ( @xmath1031 ) is forbidden , we have @xmath187 and @xmath188 .\nnote that @xmath189 .\nwe deduce from claim 1 and claim 2 that @xmath186 .\n* claim 4*. @xmath190 .\nrecall the definitions of @xmath191 and @xmath192 where @xmath142 .\neach @xmath145 contains @xmath193 mirror triangles incident with @xmath46 .\nsuppose @xmath194 of them are light and @xmath195 of them are heavy\n. then @xmath196 .\nsince ( @xmath1033 ) is forbidden , no light mirror triangle contains @xmath197-vertex .\nso the neighbors of @xmath46 in @xmath1 with degree @xmath197 are all contained either in the heavy mirror triangles or in the interval of @xmath87 .\nnote that all the image vertices contained in @xmath198 are of degree at least five ( see figure [ cal ] ) , so if there is a 4-vertex in @xmath198 , then it must be a mirror vertex . in view of this\n, one can easily claim that @xmath198 contains at most @xmath195 @xmath197-vertices .\nfurthermore , if @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , then @xmath202 are all @xmath173-vertices since ( @xmath1033 ) is forbidden in @xmath1 .\nso the triangles @xmath203 and @xmath204 are both heavy . then one can similarly claim that @xmath205 contains at most @xmath206 @xmath197-vertices , where @xmath207 .    by ( 2 ) of observation [ obs ] and the definition of @xmath145 , if there are @xmath21-vertices on @xmath87 , they must be on the interval .\nsuppose there are @xmath208 @xmath21-vertices in @xmath192 where @xmath209 .\nif @xmath210 , then @xmath192 contains at least @xmath211 non-@xmath197-vertices since ( @xmath1032 ) and ( @xmath1033 ) are forbidden . here , note that neither @xmath212 nor @xmath213 can be @xmath21-vertex by ( 2 ) of observation [ obs ] since each image vertex is adjacent to a crossing vertex in @xmath30 .\nso @xmath214 if @xmath210 .\nif @xmath199 , then @xmath215 . so the above inequation on @xmath216 holds unless @xmath200 and @xmath201 . in this special case , this inequation becomes @xmath217 indeed , but on the other hand , we have @xmath218 and @xmath219 by the former arguments . note that @xmath220 and @xmath221 .\nso we can deduce that @xmath222 .\nhence , we have @xmath190 .\nnow we apply the discharging method to the associated planar graph @xmath30 of @xmath1 . since @xmath30 is a planar graph and @xmath223 . by euler s formula\n, we have @xmath224    now we define @xmath225 to be the initial charge of @xmath226 .\nlet @xmath227 for each vertex @xmath12 and let @xmath228 and for each face @xmath229 .\nit follows that @xmath230 .\nwe now redistribute the initial charge @xmath225 and form a new charge @xmath231 for each @xmath226 by discharging method . since our rules only move charge around , and do not affect the sum , we have @xmath232 .\na @xmath21-face in @xmath30 is @xmath233 if it is incident with one crossing vertex .\nour discharging rules are defined as follows :    ( @xmath2341 ) each non - special @xmath21-face in @xmath30 receives @xmath235 from each vertex incident with it

all vertices of degree at most @xmath334 .    by theorem [ structure ]\n, @xmath1 contains one of the configuration in \\{(@xmath1033),(@xmath1034),(@xmath1035),(@xmath1036 ) } described in section @xmath335 . in each case\n, we will find a path @xmath336 in @xmath1 such that @xmath337 .\nsimilarly we can prove an analogous theorem .\nlet @xmath1 be a simple @xmath0-planar graph with minimum degree @xmath338 .\nthen @xmath1 contains a @xmath21-star with all vertices of degree at most @xmath334 .\nhence we have the following many corollaries .\n.    @xmath339 .    @xmath340 .\na mapping @xmath341 from @xmath6 to the sets of colors @xmath342 is called a @xmath22 @xmath13-@xmath343 @xmath344 of @xmath1 provided any two adjacent edges receive different colors .\nthe @xmath343 @xmath345 @xmath346 @xmath347 is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of g properly .\na @xmath22 @xmath13-@xmath343 @xmath344 @xmath341 of @xmath1 is called an @xmath348 @xmath13-@xmath343-@xmath344 of @xmath1 if there are no bichromatic cycles in @xmath1 under the coloring @xmath341 .\nthe smallest number of colors such that @xmath1 has an acyclic edge coloring is called the @xmath348 @xmath345 @xmath346 of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath349 .\nacyclic edge coloring was introduced by alon et al .\n@xcite , and they presented a linear upper bound on @xmath349 .\nit was proved that @xmath350 holds for every graph , which was later improved to @xmath351 by molloy and reed @xcite . for planar graph @xmath1 , a. fiedorowicz et al .\n@xcite proved that @xmath352 .\nrecently , hou et al .\n@xcite gave a better upon bound .\nthey showed that @xmath353 holds for each planar graph .\nlet @xmath354 be an edge coloring of @xmath1 .\nfor any vertex @xmath12 , we define @xmath355 . in this section , we consider the acyclic edge coloring of @xmath0-planar graphs .\nlet @xmath360 and @xmath361 .\nsuppose @xmath362 . by the minimality of @xmath1 ,\nthe graph @xmath363 has an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring @xmath354 with color set @xmath87 .\nlet @xmath364 and @xmath365 .\nfor the edge @xmath366 , we remain @xmath367 .\nnote that @xmath368 .\nthen @xmath369 is an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring of @xmath1 , a contradiction .\nso @xmath370 .\nlet @xmath371 .\nthen @xmath372 has an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring @xmath354 with color set @xmath87 .\nnow we let @xmath373 . since @xmath374 and @xmath375 , @xmath376 .\nnow we color @xmath377 by @xmath378 .\nit is easy to see that @xmath379 . for the edge @xmath380\n, we also remain @xmath367 .\nthen @xmath369 is again an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring of @xmath1 , a contradiction .      in this case\n, @xmath1 has one of the five configurations \\{(@xmath1032),(@xmath1033),(@xmath1034),(@xmath1035),(@xmath1036 ) } which are described in theorem [ structure ] .\nlet @xmath381 , @xmath382 , @xmath383 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 .\nsuppose @xmath1 contains the @xmath386-th configuration , where @xmath387 .\nif @xmath388 , let @xmath389 . otherwise , let @xmath371 .\nthen @xmath372 has an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring @xmath354 with color set @xmath87 . if @xmath388 , let @xmath390\notherwise , let @xmath391 .\nnow we color @xmath392 by a color @xmath393 .\nnote that @xmath374 and @xmath394 , we have @xmath395 .\nlet @xmath396 and @xmath397 where @xmath398 .\nthen we color @xmath399 in turn as follows .\nlet @xmath400 . if @xmath401 , let @xmath402 .\notherwise we let @xmath403 . at\nlast , for each @xmath404 , we let @xmath405 . for the edge @xmath380 , we still remain @xmath367 .\nnote that @xmath406 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 .\nso this coloring @xmath369 does exist .\nit is easy to check that @xmath369 is proper and acyclic .\nso we have constructed a new coloring @xmath369 which is an acyclic @xmath3-edge coloring of @xmath1 , a contradiction .\nthis completes the proof of theorem [ acyclic ] .",
