    "article": "there is strong observational evidence that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) play an important role in the formation and growth of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .\nmost supermassive black hole growth takes place during an obscured quasar phase , as suggested by the integrated energy density of the cosmic x - ray background @xcite . to understand the evolution of galaxies and to trace the energy output due to accretion and its cosmological evolution , it is critical to map the history of obscured accretion .\nx - ray surveys with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ at energies @xmath810 kev are sensitive to all but the most heavily obscured agn ( e.g. @xcite ) . in compton - thick agn ( rest - frame column densities exceeding @xmath9 ) the observed flux below 10 kev can be as low as a few % of the intrinsic nuclear flux . in the compton - thick regime the high energy photons that survive the photoelectric absorption get scattered in the absorber losing part of their energy ( compton down - scattering ) .\nthis is an important effect that can significantly suppress the transmitted continuum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nthe ongoing swift / bat and integral / ibis all - sky surveys at energies 15 - 200 kev are providing the least biased samples of absorbed agn in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nhowever , even these surveys are biased against the most heavily absorbed compton - thick agn @xcite .\nsurveys at mid - infrared ( hereafter mir ) wavelengths ( @xmath105@xmath0 m ) are much less affected by extinction since the obscuring dust re - emits the nuclear optical - to - x - ray radiation at infrared wavelengths .\nclumpy torus models predict nearly isotropic emission in the mir at wavelengths @xmath1012@xmath0 m ( @xcite ) .\nthus , mir - based surveys ( or the combination of mir and data at shorter wavelengths ) can potentially trace the elusive obscured accretion missed by hard x - ray surveys ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for example\n, it has been claimed that objects showing excess emission at @xmath1124@xmath0 m over that expected from star formation , termed `` infrared - excess galaxies '' , might host heavily obscured and compton - thick agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nhowever the exact contribution of heavily obscured agn to the infrared - excess galaxy population remains an open issue ( e.g. @xcite ) .\nseveral mir - based agn selection techniques have been developed with data from the spitzer space telescope infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) using colours and power - law selection ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nthese techniques are very effective and reliable .\ngalaxies dominated by agn emission typically exhibit a characteristic red power - law spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the mir ( @xmath12 with @xmath13@xmath140.5 ; @xcite ) .\nthus , mir power - law selection provides the cleanest samples of luminous agn ( e.g. @xcite ) .\nhowever , this technique is very sensitive to the reliability of the estimated photometric errors @xcite .\nthe wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) has now completed the first sensitive ( @xmath11100 - 1000@xmath15 deeper than iras ) coverage of the entire sky in the mir@xcite .\nseveral colour - based regions , aimed at identifying luminous agn , have already been proposed .\nthese works have shown that @xmath1 can robustly separate agn from normal galaxies and stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .\n@xmath1 will be extremely efficient in identifying the rare highly luminous agn up to the crucial epoch when the accretion power of the universe peaked ( @xmath16@xmath111 - 2 ) .\nthe all - sky @xmath1 survey will complement the deep spitzer surveys , aimed to characterize the accretion phenomenon in the distant universe .\nthis paper presents a highly reliable and complete mir - based colour selection of agn with wise .\nour technique is designed to select objects with red mir power - law seds and properly accounts for the estimated typical errors in the photometry and deviations of the mir seds from a pure power - law .\nthe agn wedge is defined using the wide - angle bright ultra - hard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( buxs ; mateos et al .  2012c , in preparation ) .\nthis survey is one of the largest complete flux - limited samples of bright `` ultra - hard '' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) x - ray selected agn to date .\nsurveys such as ` buxs ` are extremely efficient in selecting agn bright enough for reliable optical identifications and for detailed studies of their properties and evolution ( e.g. hbs28 , @xcite ; hbss , @xcite ) . `\nbuxs ` covers the region of the agn redshift - luminosity parameter space that @xmath1 will sample .\nthus , ` buxs ` offers a unique opportunity to define a highly complete and reliable mir - based agn selection with wise .\nthanks to the optical spectroscopic identifications available for @xmath1197% of the ` buxs ` objects , and the high quality x - ray spectra , we have maximized the completeness of our mir selection without compromising its reliability . in a forthcoming paper we will present and discuss the main properties of the optical / near - ir / mir seds of the agn in ` buxs ` ( mateos et al .  2012c , in preparation ) .\nthis paper is organized as follows .\nsections 2 and 3 briefly summarize the data sets . in section 4\nwe present our mir selection of agn candidates using the three shorter wavelength bands of @xmath1 and the complete four bands , respectively and we discuss the completeness of the selection .\nwe show the reliability of our agn selection in section 5 .\nthe results are summarized in section 6 . throughout this paper errors\nare 90% confidence for a single parameter and we assume @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .\n@xmath1 observed the entire sky in the mir , achieving 5@xmath20 point source sensitivities better than 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 , and 6 mjy at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m , respectively .\nthe angular resolution is 6.1@xmath21 , 6.4@xmath21 , 6.5@xmath21 , and 12.0@xmath21(fwhm ) , respectively , and the astrometric precision for high signal - to - noise ( hereafter snr ) sources is better than 0.15@xmath21(wright et al .\nwe use here the march 2012 publicly available all - sky data release that covers @xmath2299% of the sky and incorporates the best available calibrations and data reduction algorithms ( cutri et al .\n2012 ) .\nin what follows we compute flux densities in the @xmath1 bands using profile fitting photometry and the magnitude zero points of the vega system : @xmath23=309.124 jy , 171.641 jy , 30.988 jy , and 8.346 jy for 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m , respectively .\nthese values are computed with the flux correction factors that correspond to a power - law spectrum ( @xmath12 ) with spectral index @xmath24=@xmath141 presented in @xcite .\nwe note that using the flux correction factors that correspond to constant power - law spectra the difference in the computed flux densities would be less than 0.2% at 3.4 , 4.6 , and 22 @xmath0 m and @xmath112% at 12 @xmath0 m .\nwe added a 1.5% uncertainty to the catalogued flux errors in all bands to account for the overall systematic uncertainty from the vega spectrum in the flux zeropoints . to account for the existing discrepancy between the red and blue calibrators used for the conversion from magnitudes to janskys , an additional 10% uncertainty was added to the 12@xmath0 m and 22@xmath0 m fluxes ( wright et al .\n2010 ) . throughout this paper\nwe use monochromatic mir flux densities ( @xmath25 ) in janskys , unless otherwise specified .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in the previous sections we presented the @xmath1 expected colours for agn / star - forming galaxies derived from a library of templates .\nhere we investigate in more detail the colour trends in the three - band agn wedge for the ` buxs ` type-1 and type-2 agn .\n[ fig4 ] shows the mir colours of the agn in ` buxs ` as a function of their x - ray luminosity .\nas expected , there is a strong dependence of log(@xmath26 ) on the x - ray luminosity , with less luminous sources having the bluest mir colours . for less powerful agn the host galaxy can substantially contribute to the mir emission ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .\nhost galaxy dilution is expected to be more important in type-2 agn , especially at low luminosities , as type-2 agn should show a higher degree of extinction at the shortest wavelengths of wise .\nthese objects , with mir colours consistent with normal galaxies , lie outside of the agn wedge and thus , they are missed from a pure mir selection .\n[ fig2 ] and fig .\n[ fig4 ] both show that most agn in ` buxs ` missed by the 3-band wedge are type-2 agn . as noted in sec .\n[ completeness ] , in flux - limited x - ray surveys , such as ` buxs ` , type-2 agn are overall intrinsically less luminous than type-1 agn ( see fig .\n[ fig1 ] , bottom ) .\nthus , due to the strong dependence of the mir selection completeness on the luminosity of the objects ( see fig .\n[ fig3 ] , top ) , our agn wedge will preferentially pick out ` buxs ` type-1 agn .\nhowever , at luminosities @xmath27 , where the agn is expected to dominate the mir emission ( unless it is heavily absorbed ) , the completeness of the selection of type-1 and type-2 agn is comparable within the uncertainties . at such luminosities both type-1 and type-2 agn\nare preferentially located above the power - law locus ( see also fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .\nthis indicates that the observed 3.4@xmath0 m to 12@xmath0 m mir seds of powerful agn deviate from a pure power - law .\nwe do not find a strong dependence of the log(@xmath28 ) colour on the x - ray luminosity .\nhowever , we find a large scatter in the distribution of log(@xmath28 ) colours , especially for objects at low luminosities , where the host galaxy significantly contributes to the mir emission . a broad range of log(@xmath29 ) colours is expected for agn with an important host galaxy contribution as the very wide 12@xmath0 m filter of @xmath1 is very sensitive to both prominent pah emission features and silicate absorption ( 10@xmath0 m ) in star - forming galaxies over a broad range of redshifts .\nwe present a mir power - law based selection of luminous agn candidates using the 3.4 , 4.6 , and 12 @xmath0 m bands of the @xmath1 survey .\nwe defined an agn wedge in the log(@xmath26 ) vs. log(@xmath30 ) colour - colour diagram using the bright ultra - hard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( ` buxs ` ) .\nthis is one of the largest complete flux - limited samples of bright ( @xmath31 ) `` ultra - hard '' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) x - ray selected agn to date . `\nbuxs ` includes 258 objects detected over a total sky area of 44.43 deg@xmath3 : 251 ( 97.3% ) are spectroscopically identified and classified , with 145 being type-1 agn and 106 type-2 agn . our technique is based on a mir power - law selection and properly accounts for the errors in the photometry and deviations of the mir spectral energy distributions from a pure power - law . in flux - limited x - ray surveys , such as ` buxs ` , type-2 agn are intrinsically less luminous than type-1 agn .\nthus , due to the strong dependence of the mir selection completeness on the luminosity of the objects , a mir agn wedge necessarily picks out ` buxs ` type-1 agn .\nhowever , at 2 - 10 kev luminosities above @xmath32 the completeness of our mir selection of type-1 and type-2 agn is high and comparable for both types within the uncertainties .\nour selection is highly complete at luminosities @xmath4 where our mir wedge recovers @xmath1197% and @xmath1177% of the ` buxs ` type-1 and type-2 agn , respectively .\nwe identify 2755 agn candidates in the 44.43 deg@xmath3 ` buxs ` survey area of which 38.5% have detection in x - rays . in the ` buxs ` area where the x - ray observations have exposures @xmath2240ks ,\nthe x - ray detection fraction rises to 49.8% .\nthis is reasonable , as long x - ray exposures are required to detect intrinsically less luminous and/or heavily obscured agn .\na substantial fraction of the mir agn candidates remain undetected at 2 - 10kev energies with the typical exposures in the 2xmm catalogue .\nthese objects are the best candidates to account for the most heavily obscured / absorbed luminous agn missed by hard x - ray surveys .\nassuming that a 2 - 10 kev x - ray detection is a good tracer of agn activity we demonstrate that our @xmath1 selection shows one of the highest reliability amongst those in the literature .\nthis is crucial to obtain a clean mir selection of powerful agn .\nfurthermore , going down to a snr@xmath75 limit in the @xmath1 flux densities , we substantially increase the efficiency of detection of agn with the reddest mir colours .\nwe also investigate a @xmath1 four - band agn selection .\nwe show , however , that by including the 22@xmath0 m @xmath1 band neither the completeness nor the reliability of the selection improves .\nthis is likely due to both the significantly shallower depth at 22@xmath0 m compared with the first three bands of @xmath1 and star - formation contributing to the 22@xmath0 m emission at the @xmath1 22@xmath0 m sensitivity .\nthis work is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .\nbased on data from the wide -
