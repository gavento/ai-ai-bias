    "article": "collisionless shocks @xcite play an important role in energy transport and evolution of charged - particle distribution functions in space and astrophysical environments .\nalthough collisionless shocks in plasmas were first predicted in the 1950s @xcite and discovered in the 1960s @xcite , many questions relating to the microscopic physics of collisionless shock formation , evolution , and shock acceleration of particles to very high energies remain unanswered @xcite .\nlaboratory studies of collisionless shocks have been conducted since the 1960s @xcite , but a recent renaissance of laboratory collisionless shock experiments @xcite stems from the fact that modern laboratory plasmas can satisfy key physics criteria for the shocks to have `` cosmic relevance '' @xcite .\nrecently initiated experiments @xcite at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) aim to form and study astrophysically relevant collisionless shocks via the head - on merging of two supersonic plasma jets , each with order 10-cm spatial scale size .\ncompared to most other modern collisionless shock experiments which use laser - produced or wire - array z - pinch @xcite plasmas , the lanl experiment has larger shock spatial size ( up to 30-cm wide and a few - cm thick ) and longer shock time duration ( order 10  @xmath6s ) but somewhat lower sonic and alfvn mach numbers .\nthe lanl experiment plans to have the capability to apply magnetic fields of a few kg ( via coils ) that can be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of shock propagation . obtaining physical insights into and experimental data on collisionless shock structure , evolution , and\ntheir effects on particle dynamics are the primary reasons to conduct laboratory experiments on collisionless shocks .\nthis paper reports results from particle - in - cell ( pic ) and hybrid - pic numerical simulations , using the lsp code @xcite , that informed the design of the lanl experiment and showed that collisionless shocks should appear with the expected plasma jet parameters .    after a brief description of the lanl collisionless shock experiment\n, the remainder of the paper describes single - jet propagation and one- ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) pic head - on merging jet simulations .\nour 1d magnetized simulations , in which the jets are immersed in an applied magnetic field , are similar to those of shimada and hoshino @xcite who performed 1d pic simulations of magnetized shock formation using a reduced ion - to - electron mass ratio and a reflection boundary to model counter - propagating plasmas .\nwe use the actual hydrogen mass ratio and the actual hydrogen plasma parameters expected in the lanl experiments , and we directly simulate both jets .\nthis gives us the flexibility to independently vary the properties ( _ e.g. _ , the density profile ) of the two jets without assuming any symmetry .\nwe have also performed 2d cartesian merging simulations of magnetized jets which allows us to consider the effects of the orientation of the magnetic field and plasma density gradients with respect to the jet propagation direction .\nthese simulations demonstrate shock formation caused by the merging of magnetized jets with mach numbers as low as @xmath7 , where the mach number is defined as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pre - shock jet velocity in the shock frame , @xmath10 is the alfvn velocity ( in si units ) where @xmath11 is the pre - shock magnetic field strength @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the pre - shock ion density , @xmath13 is the ion mass , and @xmath14 where the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pre - shock electron and ion temperatures in energy units .    in unmagnetized plasmas , collisionless shocks may also be formed by the weibel instability @xcite . simulations of this mechanism were described by kato and takabe @xcite , whose simulations were also performed at a reduced mass ratio and were restricted to relatively high velocities ( @xmath17 ) .\nwhen using the hydrogen mass ratio and a lower velocity ( @xmath18 km / s as expected in the experiment ) , we find no shock formation on relevant timescales ( a few @xmath6s ) .\nthe outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .\n[ sec : setup - model ] we describe the simulation setup and numerical models used . in sec .\n[ sec : results ] , we present lsp  simulation results of single hydrogen jet propagation ( sec .  [\nsec : single - h - jet ] and [ sec : fully - kinetic - single ] ) and 1d ( sec .\n[ sec:1d - magnetized - shock ] ) and 2d ( sec .\n[ sec:2d - simul - magn ] ) jet - merging with applied magnetic fields .\nconclusions are given in sec .\n[ sec : conclusions ] .\nthe simulations described in this paper are based on the lanl collisionless shock experiment @xcite , which uses counter - propagating plasma jets formed and launched by plasma railguns @xcite mounted on opposite sides of a 2.74  m diameter spherical vacuum chamber ( fig .\n[ fg : exp ] ) .\nhydrogen , helium , and argon jets have been used in the experiments , but we focus exclusively on hydrogen in this paper due to its ability to better satisfy the physics criteria for cosmically relevant collisionless shocks @xcite .\nsingle - jet parameters and evolution have been characterized experimentally @xcite in preparation for using an array of thirty such jets to form spherically imploding plasma liners as a standoff compression driver for magneto - inertial fusion @xcite . for these collisionless shock studies , lower - density ( @xmath19@xmath1  @xmath2 ) and higher - velocity ( 100  km / s )\njets are desired ; this is accomplished primarily by reducing the injected mass for a given gun current .\n[ fg : exp ]    the approach used in this numerical study is two - fold .\nwe initially perform a large - scale simulation of a single jet propagating from the end of the plasma gun to the center of the vacuum chamber .\nthe hydrogen jets emerge from the plasma gun with densities on the order of @xmath19@xmath1 @xmath2 and temperatures of a few ev .\nthe jets emerging from the guns will be few centimeters in size ( on the order of the railgun aperture ) with masses of a few @xmath6 g , and will have a drift velocity @xmath18 km / s .\nbut both must propagate on the order of 1  m before merging can begin , during which time the density , temperature , and equation - of - state ( eos ) of the jet can change . the single - jet propagation simulation models the time evolution of the initial jet as it propagates through the chamber .\nthis 2d @xmath20@xmath21 simulation must be run for several @xmath6s .\nthis requires using a fairly large timestep , for which @xmath22 at an initial plasma density @xmath23 @xmath2 , where @xmath24 is the electron plasma frequency .\nsuch simulations must be done with a hybrid - pic approach in which electron plasma oscillations do need not to be resolved .    however , a fully kinetic approach is required to model the formation of shocks due to micro - instabilities induced by jet merging . as will be seen in sec .\n[ sec : single - h - jet ] , the hydrogen jets ejected from the plasma guns drop considerably in density as they propagate to the center of the chamber where the merging takes place .\nthis density reduction during propagation allows us to perform fully kinetic explicit pic merging simulations in 1d and 2d cartesian coordinates , in which electron timescales are resolved ( @xmath25 ) .\nso these simulations , which are initialized with plasma parameters obtained from the propagation simulation , are intended to model only the merging process which occurs much later than the ejection of the jets from the guns .\nall of these simulations are performed using the hybrid - pic code lsp @xcite , which has been utilized widely and validated for applications in many areas of beam and plasma physics , including streaming instabilities @xcite and landau damping @xcite .\nin addition to the traditional pic paradigm , i.e. , a maxwell - vlasov solver for collisionless plasmas in which electron length and time scales must be resolved , lsp also contains algorithms for dense plasma simulation and includes physics modules for collisions ( among charged and neutral species ) , eos modeling , and radiation transport .\nthis flexibility available in the code makes it useful for the two - fold simulation approach described above .\nall of the simulation results presented later in the paper have been checked to assure convergence of the relevant physics results with respect to numerical parameters such as cell size , timestep , and particle number per cell . to more\nfully focus on the physics results in the remaining sections of the paper , we provide in this section details on the models and numerical parameters used for the simulations .\nthe jet propagation simulation is performed in lsp using a quasi - neutral hybrid - pic algorithm @xcite which has fewer constraints on the timestep .\nthe ion macroparticles are kinetic .\nbut there are no electron macroparticles , as the ions carry fluid information for the inertia - less electrons .\nthe equation of motion for the composite ion - electron macroparticle is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the macroparticle velocity , @xmath28 is the electron pressure , and @xmath29 is the full time derivative for the lagrangian macroparticle .\nthe current is given by ohm s law : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron density , @xmath32 is the conductivity , and @xmath33 is the drift velocity gathered at the grid nodes . the fields , current , densities , and electron pressure gradient are all calculated at the nodes and then interpolated to the macroparticle position when eq .\n( [ eq : eom ] ) is applied .\nthe full maxwell s equations are solved with the ohm s law term included .\ndisplacement current is not dropped .\nkinetic ions also undergo self - collisions ( ion - ion ) .\nit is for this reason that there is no ion pressure contribution to eq .\n( [ eq : eom ] ) .\ncoulomb collisions between electrons and ions species are included self - consistently through the spitzer conductivity in eq .\n( [ eq : ohm ] ) .\nparticle energies are advanced by the same method which is described in ref .\nthe plasma eos ( plasma internal energy , charge state , @xmath34 , etc . )  and opacity tables for radiation transport are provided by the propaceos code @xcite .\nalthough lsp includes a full radiation transport algorithm @xcite , in this simulation we include only photon emission and neglect absorption .\nthis allows radiation to be modeled as a simple energy sink on the fluid electron species .\nthis approximation is justified in the optically thin regime , which is well satisfied for jets in the parameter regime under consideration .\nthe single jet propagation simulation is carried out in 2d @xmath20@xmath21 cylindrical coordinates , as the jet is assumed to be azimuthally symmetric .\nthis allows for full spatial hydrodynamic expansion of the jet in a 2d simulation .\nthe simulation space is large enough to allow for propagation of the initial jet from the exit of the gun to the center of the vacuum chamber , and is bounded by perfectly conducting metal walls .\nthe cell size is @xmath35  cm , and the timestep is given by @xmath36  cm .\nthe use of the uniformly stable exact - implicit field solver allows the simulation to be run with @xmath37 the cell size @xcite .\nthe initial plasma is characterized by @xmath38 ion macroparticles per cell .\nthe results of the simulation are discussed in sec .\n[ sec : single - h - jet ] .      the 1d cartesian fully kinetic propagation and merging simulations\nare initialized with input parameters based on results of the hybrid - pic single jet propagation simulation . as will be seen in sec .\n[ sec : single - h - jet ] , the jets at the chamber center have a much lower density ( @xmath39 @xmath2 ) than when ejected from the plasma guns .\nthis allows us do explicit kinetic pic simulations .\nwe can also afford better spatial and temporal resolution in 1d cartesian coordinates : @xmath40  cm .\nsince the timestep is small , an explicit field solution is used rather than the exact - implicit solver .\nboth electrons and ions are modeled kinetically .\ncoulomb collisions are included for the electron species , as are ion collisions , which are found to have a negligible effect in this parameter regime . the cell size and time step given above resolve not only @xmath24 , but also the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) , and ion and electron skin depths ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively )\n. a cloud - in - cell @xcite particle model allows @xmath45 the debye length .\nthe 1d simulations described below are all run with several thousand macroparticles per cell .\nwe assume fully stripped hydrogen ions ( @xmath46 ) for simplicity .\nsome justification for this assumption is given below .\nwe also assume an ideal gas eos for the plasma jets and neglect radiation losses .\nwe initially perform a few fully kinetic single - jet propagation simulations with and without magnetic fields to demonstrate the effect of applied fields on single jet propagation .\nthese results are described in sec .\n[ sec : fully - kinetic - single ] . in sec .\n[ sec:1d - magnetized - shock ] we discuss the results of 1d fully kinetic simulations of two - jet merging with and without applied magnetic fields .\nwe consider the effects of varying magnetic field strengths , as well as the effect of finite density gradients ( with scale length @xmath47 ) , and the effect of the initial spatial separation , or gap @xmath48 , between the two jets .\nthe last group of simulations considered in this paper are in 2d cartesian coordinates .\nwe simulate the 2d jets in the @xmath49@xmath50  plane , with the jets propagating in the @xmath49 direction .\nthe total @xmath50 extent is many @xmath51 wide , and periodic boundaries are imposed at minimum and maximum values of @xmath50 . to maintain reasonable runtimes , 2d simulations performed at realistic length scales ( jet lengths @xmath52100  cm ) require coarser spatial resolution ( @xmath53  cm ) and a smaller number of particles per cell ( tens rather than hundreds ) than were possible in 1d .\ncoulomb collisions are included , but we again assume an ideal eos and neglect radiation transport ( both photon emission and absorption ) .    in sec .\n[ sec:2d - simul - magn ] we consider the results of 2d cartesian simulations of counter - propagating jets in perpendicular magnetic fields .\nas in 1d , the jet propagation remains in the @xmath49 direction , and we simulate the 2d jets in the @xmath49@xmath50  plane .\nthe total @xmath50 extent is many @xmath51 wide , and periodic boundaries are imposed at minimum and maximum values of @xmath50 .    in these simulations\nwe find some slow numerical heating of the electrons at later times due to the coarse spatial resolution of the grid ( @xmath54 ) .\nhowever , if the simulation duration does not exceed @xmath55  @xmath6s , the energy conservation remains good to within a few percent .\nhigh fidelity simulations over longer time scales will require better spatial resolution and larger particle numbers .\nthis will require the use of more processors than were available .\nhybrid - pic lsp simulations were performed of a single hydrogen plasma jet propagating from the railgun nozzle to the center of the chamber in order to connect the plasma jet parameters at the railgun exit with those in the region of head - on jet merging .\ndetails on the simulation setup and numerical methods are given in sec .\n[ sec : setup - single - jet ]\n. the initial ion density @xmath12 profile can be in seen in the upper left plot in fig .\n[ fg : ni_trans ] . at @xmath56\nthe single jet is assumed to have a peak density @xmath57 @xmath2 ( total mass @xmath58 @xmath6 g ) , electron and ion temperatures @xmath59  ev , and @xmath60  km / s ( in the @xmath61 direction ) .\nthe initial jet parameters are also given in table  [ tab_trans ] .\nthe time evolution of the jet propagation can be seen in fig .\n[ fg : ni_trans ] , which shows @xmath12 contours at @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65  @xmath6s .\nfigure  [ fg : n_trans_lo ] shows @xmath12 line - outs at the same times .\nthe approximate plasma parameters of the jet at the center of the chamber ( @xmath66  cm ) are also given in table  [ tab_trans ] .\nso this simulation determines the approximate parameter regime of the individual jets after they have propagated to the center of the chamber and begun to merge : @xmath67  @xmath2 , @xmath68  km / s , @xmath69  ev , @xmath70 1 , and @xmath71 cm .\nwe note that from spectroscopic data obtained from the lanl experiment the plasma density at the chamber center can be inferred to be below @xmath19 @xmath2 , which is consistent with the simulation result .\nthe experimental jets are expected to be somewhat colder when emerging from the guns than the 5-ev value used in the simulations .\nbut in the simulation results radiation cooling quickly causes the jet temperature to drop .\nnonetheless , we expect the amount of density decay seen in the simulation to be an upper bound on the experiments .\nbased on the results of this simulation , we have chosen a set of simplified plasma parameters to be used for the fully kinetic simulations discussed in the following subsections . these values are given in table  [ tab_merge ] .\nusing these parameters we can estimate the coulomb collision frequency for the jets . to observe collisionless merging of the jets ,\nit is necessary that the inter - jet ion collision time be much larger than the jet interaction time @xmath72 . for two counter - propagating ion beams ( @xmath73 , the ion thermal velocity ) , the spitzer collision frequency is proportional to @xmath74 @xcite . using the parameters above\n, we find @xmath75  s. the ion stopping time due to collisions with electrons in the opposing jet is @xmath76  s , while the jet interaction time @xmath77\ns. so this simulation result demonstrates that these counter - propagating jets will indeed be in the collisionless regime when the jets merge at the center of the chamber , allowing the lanl facility to be used for the investigation of collisionless shock formation .\n[ fg : ni_trans ]        [ fg : n_trans_lo ]    .initial and approximate parameters at the center of the chamber ( @xmath78 ns ) in 2d @xmath20@xmath21 jet propagation simulation ( see also figs .\n[ fg : ni_trans ] and [ fg : n_trans_lo ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_accel ]      in this section we consider the results of 2d cartesian simulations of counter - propagating jets in perpendicular magnetic fields .\nthe jet propagation remains in the @xmath49 direction , and we simulate the 2d jets in the @xmath49@xmath50  plane . in 2d , we now have to explicitly specify the direction of the perpendicular field in the @xmath50@xmath21 plane .\ndetails on the simulation setup were given in sec .\n[ sec : setup - explicit-2d ] .\nwe consider initially a quasi-1d simulation with no variation of any physical quantity in the @xmath50 direction and periodic boundaries in @xmath50 .\nthe initial density profiles can be seen in the top row of fig .\n[ fg : ni_q2d ] .\nthe full initial conditions for all the 2d runs are given in table  [ tab_merge ] .\nthe total @xmath50 extent is many @xmath51 wide .\nthe initial conditions are @xmath79 @xmath2 , @xmath80  ev . the magnetic field is in the @xmath81 direction ( analogous to the 1d simulations as the field is aligned in a virtual direction ) with @xmath82  g and @xmath83 km / s .\nwe first note from the bottom row of fig .\n[ fg : ni_q2d ] , which shows @xmath12 and @xmath84 contours at @xmath85  ns , well after the shock formation , that there is no strongly evident structure in the @xmath50 direction in the bulk of the jets , although the @xmath50 extent is many @xmath51 wide .\nthere is some small density variation along the @xmath86 line where the density is very low , but these variations are on the order of a cell size and are probably due to particle noise .    due to the coarse spatial grid\n, we can no longer resolve the oscillatory structure along the @xmath49-direction in the shock transition region , which were seen in the highly resolved 1d simulations ( e.g. , see fig .\n[ fg : n_xpx_2jet_1 kg ] ) .\nbut we obtain the same shock speed ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) and density discontinuity , @xmath88 , as the corresponding 1d simulation .\n[ fg : ni_q2d ]    we now consider two uniform density disks with no applied magnetic field .\nthe periodic boundaries in @xmath50 have been retained .\nion density contours and @xmath49@xmath89 particle phase - space data are shown in fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dnob ] .\nthe results are analogous to the unmagnetized 1d case , i.e. , there is very little interaction between the jets in this parameter regime in the absence of an applied magnetic field .\nthere is certainly no evidence of weibel - induced unmagnetized shock waves on time scales @xmath90  @xmath6s .\n[ fg : ni_2dnob ]    we repeat the previous simulation but now add a 350-g magnetic field in the virtual direction ( @xmath81 ) .\nthe @xmath12 and @xmath84 contours are shown at various times in fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dwb ] . along the line @xmath91  cm , we find approximate values of @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , and a shock velocity of @xmath94  km / s . although the problem is now inherently 2d , we nonetheless estimate @xmath95 from the 1d formula of eq .\n( [ eq : mach ] ) .\nwe notice , however , that there is a conspicuous difference between this simulation and the 1d and quasi-1d ( fig .\n[ fg : ni_q2d ] ) analogs .\nnamely , the density at the center - of - mass of the two jets , along the line at @xmath96 , remains large ( @xmath97  @xmath2 ) throughout the simulation , indicating at least some jet interpenetration at this point . in the 1d analogs , the density remained close to zero at the jet center of mass .    in order to explain this qualitatively different behavior , we consider first the results for a 2d simulation in which the 350-g field is rotated from the virtual @xmath81 to the @xmath98 direction , which lies in the simulation plane .\nthese results are shown in fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dwby ] . for this simulation\nwe find , along @xmath99  cm , that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .\nfor this magnetic field orientation , the results are qualitatively similar to the 1d case , as @xmath12 remains zero along @xmath96 .\nwhen the magnetic field is in the @xmath50 direction ( fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dwby ] ) , the currents which drive the magnetic field , @xmath102 , can flow in the virtual @xmath21 direction and remain localized near @xmath96  cm .\nthis allows for large @xmath103 forces to reflect the incoming the jets .\nwhen the magnetic field is in the virtual @xmath21-direction ( fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dwb ] ) the magnetic field is supported by finite circular current paths around the perimeter of the bulk of the jet .\nthe density gradient in @xmath50 acts to minimize the @xmath49 component of the @xmath104 force on the jets .\n[ fg : ni_2dwb ]    [ fg : ni_2dwby ]    as a final simulation , we consider a 2d simulation with more realistic density gradients .\nthe 350-g field is in the @xmath81 direction .\nthe initial @xmath12 contours can be seen in the top left of fig .\n[ fg : ni_2dgrad ] . from the @xmath12 and @xmath84 contours at later times\n, we note that it is difficult to clearly see the propagation front in the density contours as they are imposed on top of the initial gradient , but the magnetic field front of the shock is clearly seen in the field contours .\nthe simulation results from figs .\n[ fg : n_xpx_2jet_varyn ] and [ fg : ni_2dwby ] demonstrate that shock structure can be observed in magnetized jets with realistic density gradients .\n[ fg : ni_2dgrad ]\nwe have performed 1d and 2d pic simulations of hydrogen plasma jet propagation and head - on merging . in the parameter regime of the lanl experiment , unmagnetized collisionless shocks\ncould not be detected in the simulation results .\nthe simulations do demonstrate the formation of magnetized ( perpendicular ) collisionless shocks when @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .\nthis requires that the jets be immersed in a field @xmath1071  kg .\nsimulations predict @xmath1082 in this parameter range .\nnon - shock jet interactions ( i.e. , the alfvn wave propagation discussed in sec .\n[ sec : effects - real - dens ] ) are also observed in the simulations as well as ion kinetic effects . these simulation confirm that the application of an appropriate magnetic field to the lanl experiment is required .\nsome simple calculations as well as preliminary simulations show that an applied field can not fully diffuse into the oncoming jets on time scales @xmath109  @xmath6s . for this reason\nthe jets need to be `` born '' in the magnetic field or penetrate into the field by some other mechanism than magnetic diffusion  @xcite . since\napplied fields were shown to suppress ambipolar diffusion [ see fig .\n[ fg : n_xpx](c ) ] , it would be valuable to perform a large - scale 2d jet propagation simulation to see how jets would evolve when born or injected into applied fields . larger - scale 2d or 3d simulations require better spatial resolution to avoid numerical difficulties for longer simulation times ( @xmath110  @xmath6s ) . although not considered in this paper , we point out that the lanl experiment should also be able to observe unmagnetized _ collisional _ shocks with higher density merging jets and has observed such phenomena @xcite .\nthis work was supported by the laboratory directed research and development ( ldrd ) program at lanl through u.s .\ndept .  of energy contract\nde -
