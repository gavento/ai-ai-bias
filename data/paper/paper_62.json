    "article": "the characterization of states and operations at the quantum level plays a leading role in the development of quantum technology .\na state reconstruction technique is a method that provides the complete description of a physical system upon the measurements of an observable or a set of observables @xcite .\nan effective reconstruction technique gives the maximum possible knowledge of the state , thus allowing one to make the best , at least the best probabilistic , predictions on the results of any measurement that may be performed on the system . at a first sight\n, there is an unavoidable tradeoff between the complexity of the detection scheme and the amount of extractable information , which can be used to reconstruct the quantum state @xcite .\ncurrently , the most effective quantum state reconstruction technique for the radiation field is quantum homodyne tomography @xcite , which requires the measurement of a continuous set of field quadrature and allows for the reliable reconstruction of any quantity expressible in terms of an expectation value @xcite .\na question arises on whether the tradeoff may be overcome by a suitable experimental configuration or it corresponds to some fundamental limitations . here\nwe demonstrate that no specific discrimination power is required to the detector in either amplitude or phase , and that full state reconstruction is possible by a suitable processing of the data obtained with detectors revealing light in the simplest way , i.e. on / off detectors , such as single - photon avalanche photodiodes . of course , some form of phase and/or amplitude modulation is necessary , which , in our scheme , is imposed to the field before the detection stage .\nin fact , our technique is built on the completeness of any set of displaced number states @xcite and the reliable maximum likelihood reconstruction of arbitrary photon - number distributions @xcite from on / off data .\nthe paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : rec ] we describe our reconstruction method , whereas in section [ s : exp ] the experimental setup used in the reconstruction is described in some details .\nresults are illustrated in section [ s : res ] and the error analysis is reported in section [ s : err ] . in section [ s : dis ]\nwe discuss few additional topics while section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .\nwe start to describe our reconstruction technique by observing that the modulation of a given signal , described by the density matrix @xmath0 , corresponds to the application of a coherent displacement ( probe ) @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in practice\n, it can be easily obtained by mixing the state under investigation with a known coherent reference in a beam - splitter or a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite . upon varying amplitude and phase of the coherent reference and/or the overall transmissivity of the interferometer\n, the modulation may be tuned in a relatively broad range of values . the main idea behind our method is simple : the photon distributions of coherently modulated signals , i.e. the diagonal elements @xmath3 of the density matrix @xmath4 , contain relevant information about the complete density matrix of the original signal @xmath0 . upon measuring or reconstructing the photon distribution @xmath5 for different values of the modulation one has enough information for full state reconstruction .\nby re - writing the above relation as @xmath6 , the off diagonal matrix elements may be recovered upon inversion by least square method , i.e. @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of modulating phases , @xmath9 the truncation dimension of the fock space , and @xmath10 depends only on @xmath11 @xcite .\nstate reconstruction by the above formula requires , in principle , only phase modulation of the signal under investigation .\nmaximum likelihood methods and iterative procedures may be also used @xcite .\non the other hand , the wigner function may be reconstructed using its very definition in terms of displacement @xcite @xmath12 = \\sum_n ( -)^n\\ , p_n ( \\alpha)\\:.\\ ] ] as a matter of fact , the measurement of the photon distribution is challenging as photo - detectors that can operate as photon counters are rather rare and affected either by a low quantum efficiency @xcite or require cryogenic conditions , thus impairing common use @xcite .\ntherefore , a method with displacement but without photo - counting has been used so far only for states in the 0 - 1 subspace of the fock space @xcite . on the other hand ,\nthe experimental reconstructions of photon - number distributions for both continuous - wave and pulsed light beams is possible using simple on / off single - photon avalanche photodetectors .\nthis requires the collection of the frequencies of the _ off _ events , @xmath13 at different quantum efficiencies of the detector , @xmath14 .\nthe data are then used in a recursive maximum likelihood reconstruction algorithm that yields the photon - number distributions as @xmath15),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the probability of _ off _ events calculated from the reconstructed distribution at the @xmath18th iteration @xcite .\nthe effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated for single - mode @xcite and multimode fields @xcite , and also applied to improve quantum key distribution @xcite .    since the implementation of the modulation is relatively easy , we have thus a reconstruction technique which provides the quantum state of radiation modes and requires only avalanche detectors , without any phase or amplitude discrimination power . here\n, we develop the idea into a proper reconstruction technique and demonstrate the reconstruction of the wigner function @xcite and the density matrix for different states of the optical field .\nwe have performed two experiments for the reconstruction of the wigner function and the density matrix respectively . in fig .\n[ f : setup ] we sketch the corresponding experimental setups : the upper panel for the measurement of the wigner function and the lower panel for the density matrix ( lower panel ) . the first set of measurements was performed on ps - pulsed light fields at 523 nm wavelength .\nthe light source was the second - harmonic output of a nd : ylf mode - locked laser amplified at 5 khz ( high q laser production ) delivering pulses of @xmath19  ps duration .\nthe field , spatially filtered by means of a confocal telescope , was split into two parts to give both signal and probe .\nthe photon - number distribution of the probe was kept poissonian , while the coherent photon - number distribution of the signal field was modified in order to get suitable states of light . in particular , we have generated two phase - insensitive classical states , namely a phase - averaged coherent state and a single - mode thermal state .\nthe first one was obtained by changing the relative phase between signal and probe fields at a frequency of @xmath20 hz by means of a piezoelectric movement ( pz in the upper panel of fig .\n[ f : setup ] ) , covering 1.28  @xmath21 m span . on the other hand , to get the single - mode thermal state we inserted an arecchi s rotating ground glass disk on the pathway of the signal field followed by a pin - hole that selected a single coherence area .\nsignal and probe fields were mixed in an unpolarizing cube beam - splitter ( bs ) and a portion of the exiting field was sent , through a multimode optical fiber ( 600 @xmath21 m core - diameter ) , to a hybrid photodetector module ( hpd , mod .\nh8236 - 40 , hamamatsu , maximum quantum efficiency @xmath22=0.4 at 550 nm ) .\nalthough the detector is endowed with partial photon resolving capability , we used it as a simple on / off detector by setting a threshold at the value corresponding to zero detected photons .\nits output current pulses were suitably gate - integrated by a sr250 module ( stanford research systems , ca ) and sampled to produce a voltage , which was digitized and recorded at each shot . in order to modulate the amplitude of the probe field ,\na variable neutral density filter was placed on its pathway .\nthe maximum overall detection efficiency , calculated by including the losses of the collection optics , was @xmath23 .\nwe used a polarizer put in front of the fiber to vary the quantum efficiency of the detection chain from @xmath24 to 0 .\nhere we illustrate the reconstruction obtained for the wigner function and the density matrix of phase - averaged coherent states and thermal states , as obtained by our method after recording the on / off statistics of amplitude- and/or phase - modulated signals .    .\nthe two insets show the reconstructed photon distributions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , corresponding to the off distributions indicated by the arrows .\nthe vertical black bars denote the mean value of the photon number for the two distributions ( @xmath27 , upper , and @xmath28 , lower ) . in the lower left plot\nwe report the corresponding reconstructed wigner function . in the lower right plot\nwe report the wigner functions for signals in ( blue ) thermal state and ( yellow , with sharper peak ) vacuum .\n[ f : wsamm ] ]    in fig .\n[ f : wsamm ] we report the reconstructed wigner functions for a phase - averaged coherent state with real amplitude @xmath29 and a thermal state with average number of photons @xmath30 . the wigner function of the vacuum state is also reported for comparison . as it is apparent from the plots all the relevant features of the wigner functions\nare well recovered , including oscillations and the broadening due to thermal noise . in this case\nraw data are frequencies of the _ off _ event ( collected over 30000 laser shots ) as a function of detector efficiency , taken at different amplitudes of the modulating field , whereas the intermediate step corresponds to the reconstruction of the @xmath5 .\nthe insets of fig .\n[ f : wsamm ] display @xmath5 for the phase - averaged coherent state at two values of the modulation .     and @xmath31 .\nin the lower left plot ( left ) we report the corresponding reconstructed density matrix in the fock representation ( diagonal and subdiagonal elements ) . in the lower right plot\nwe report the density matrix for the signal excited in a thermal state .\n[ f : dmphm ] ]    the second set of measurements has been performed to achieve state reconstruction with phase modulation . here\nthe light source was a he - ne laser beam attenuated to single - photon regime by neutral density filters .\nthe spatial profile of the beam was purified from non - gaussian components by a spatial filter . beyond a beam - splitter ,\npart of the beam was addressed to a control detector in order to monitor the laser amplitude fluctuations , while the remaining part was sent to a mach - zehnder interferometer .\na piezo - movement system allowed changing the phase between the `` short '' and `` long '' paths by driving the position of the reflecting prism with nanometric resolution and high stability .\nthe beam on the short arm represented the probe , while the beam on the long arm was the state to be reconstructed . in the first acquisition\nthe signal was the coherent state itself while in the second acquisition it was a pseudo - thermal state generated as described above .\nthe detector , a perkin - elmer single photon avalanche photodiode ( spcm - aqr ) with quantum efficiency @xmath32 , was gated by a 20 ns time window at a repetition rate of 200  khz . to obtain a reasonable statistics , a single run consisted of 5 repetitions of acquisitions lasting 4  s each . in the bottom part of fig .\n[ f : dmphm ] we report the reconstructed density matrix in the fock representation ( diagonal and subdiagonal ) for a coherent state with real amplitude @xmath33 and a thermal state with average number of photons equal to @xmath34 .    as it is apparent from the plots the off - diagonal elements are correctly reproduced in both cases despite the limited visibility . here\nthe raw data are frequencies of the _ off _ event as a function of the detector efficiency , taken at different phase modulations , @xmath35 , whereas the intermediate step corresponds to the reconstruction of the photon distribution for the phase - modulated signals . in our experiments\nwe used @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the coherent state and @xmath38 for the thermal state .\nthe use of a larger @xmath8 would allow the reliable reconstruction of far off - diagonal elements , which is not possible in the present configuration . in the insets of fig .\n[ f : dmphm ] we report the reconstructed distributions at the minimum and maximum of the interference fringes .\nthe evaluation of uncertainties on the reconstructed states involves the contributions of experimental fluctuations of on / off frequencies as well as the statistical fluctuations connected with photon - number reconstruction .\nit has been argued @xcite that fluctuations involved in the reconstruction of the photon distribution may generally result in substantial limitations in the information obtainable on the quantum state , e.g. in the case of multipeaked distributions @xcite . for our purposes\nthis implies that neither large displacement amplitudes may be employed , nor states with large field and/or energy may be reliably reconstructed , although the mean values of the fields measured here are definitely non - negligible . on the other hand , for the relevant regime of weak field or low energy , observables characterizing the quantum state\ncan be safely evaluated from experimental data , including e.g. the parity operator used to reconstruct the wigner function in the phase - space . in our experiments ,\nthe errors on the reconstructed wigner function are of the order of the size of the symbols in fig .\n[ f : dmphm ] whereas the absolute errors @xmath39 on the reconstruction of the density matrix in the fock basis are reported in fig .\n[ f : err ] .     between reconstructed and theoretical values of the density matrix elements for the coherent ( left ) and thermal ( right ) states used in our experiments .\nwe have so far reconstructed the wigner function and the density matrix for coherent and thermal states . the extension to highly nonclassical states\ndoes not require qualitative changes in the setups .\nthe only difference stays in the displacement , which should be obtained with high transmissivity beam splitter in order to avoid mixing of the signal @xcite .    as our method involves a beam splitter where the signal interferes with a reference state in order to obtain the displacement , we have optimized the effectiveness of mode matching and of the overall scheme by standard visibility test . we note that in this point our technique is similar to quantum homodyne tomography ( qht ) , where the signal is amplified by the mixing at a beam splitter with a strong local oscillator .\nthe main difference with standard qht , however , is the spectral domain of the measurement , which for qht is confined to the sideband chosen for the measurement , while it is not in our case . the use of pulsed temporal homodyning @xcite would remove this limitation of qht\nhowever , this technique is still challenging from the experimental point of view and thus of limited use .\nthe effect of photodetectors efficiency should be also taken into account .\nthis is a crucial issue for qht , which may even prevent effective reconstruction @xcite . for the present on / off reconstrucion\n, it does not dramatically affect the accuracy @xcite .\nnotice also that any uncertainty in the nominal efficiency @xmath24 of the involved photodetectors does not substantially affect the reconstruction @xcite .\nwe stress that our method is especially suited for low excited states , as it does not involve intense fields and delicate balancing to reveal the relevant quantum fluctuations .\nin conclusion , we have demonstrated a state reconstruction technique providing wigner function and density matrix of a field mode starting from on / off photodetection of amplitude- and/or phase - modulated versions of the signal under investigation .\nour scheme is little demanding as to the detectors , with the amplitude and phase control required for full state characterization transferred to the optical setup , and appears to be reliable and simple especially for states with small number of photons .\nwe foresee a possible widespread use in emerging quantum technologies like quantum information , metrology and lithography .\nthis work has been partially supported by the cnr -
