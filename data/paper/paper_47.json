this is arrived at by combining the present theory with rosenfeld and tarazona s expression for the isochoric temperature dependence of the potential energy .\nwe term a microscopic configuration `` physically relevant '' if its influence on the thermodynamics and dynamics of the sustem is not _ a priori _ negligible ( paper iv ) .\nfor instance , any configuration with very strong particle overlap is physically irrelevant ; note , however , that even unlikely configurations like transition states are relevant .\ntwo state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with temperatures @xmath32 and @xmath33 and densities @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , are defined to be _ isomorphic _ ( paper iv ) if they obey the following : any two physically relevant configurations of state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which trivially scale into one another , @xmath38 have proportional configurational boltzmann statistical weights : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the potential energy function and it is understood that the constant @xmath41 depends only on the state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .\nthe property of being isomorphic defines a mathematical equivalence relation on the set of state points .\nthe corresponding equivalence classes are smooth curves in the phase diagram termed isomorphs or isomorphic curves .\nequation ( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) implies identity of the normalized boltzmann probabilities for scaled relevant configurations of isomorphic state points .\nas detailed in paper iv this identity implies that several quantities are invariant along an isomorph .\nexamples include the configurational entropy , the isochoric specific heat , n - particle distribution functions in reduced units ( in particular , the radial distribution function(s ) ) , reduced - unit dynamics ( both for newtonian and stochastic dynamics ) , normalized reduced - time autocorrelation functions , reduced - unit transport coefficients , etc .\nit was further shown in paper iv that a jump from an equilibrium state to an isomorphic state point brings the system instantaneously to equilibrium ( see also ref . ) .\nipl potentials are euler homogeneous functions , i.e. , obey @xmath42 .\nsuch purely repulsive potentials  which do not describe real intermolecular interactions  are the only potentials that have 100% correlation between virial and potential energy fluctuations ; this reflects the well - known ipl virial - theorem identity @xmath43 .\nlikewise , only ipl liquids have exact isomorphs ; they satisfy eq .\n( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) with @xmath44 for all configurations of two state points obeying @xmath45 where @xmath25 .\nappendix a of paper iv showed that strongly correlating liquids generally have isomorphs to a good approximation .\nconsequently , to a good approximation these liquids inherit a number of the exact invariants that ipl liquids have along their curves given by @xmath46 , namely all the ipl invariants that do not rely on the ipl identity @xmath44 .\nexamples include the above mentioned thermodynamic , static , and dynamic isomorph invariants .\nipl invariants that are not inherited by strongly correlating liquids in general include , e.g. , the helmholtz free energy over temperature , the potential energy over temperature , and the reduced - unit compressibility .    the fact that strongly correlating liquids have isomorphs to a good approximation should be understood as follows\n. any liquid has curves in its phase diagram of constant excess entropy , curves of constant isochoric specific heat , curves of constant reduced relaxation time , curves of constant reduced - unit transport coefficients , etc . for a strongly correlating liquid these curves are almost identical , and they define its ( approximate ) isomorphs .\npoints on these isomorphs have approximately identical structure and approximately identical dynamics as probed , e.g. , by normalized reduced - time - autocorrelation functions .    for clarity of presentation below we shall not repeatedly mention that the existence of isomorphs is not exact for generalized lj systems .\naccordingly , we shall speak of isomorphs as a unique , well - defined concept . in other words : all properties of isomorphs derived below in generalized lj systems would be exact if these systems did have exact isomorphs , e.g. , fulfilled eq .\n( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) ; since this is not the case , the properties are in principle  as well as practice  approximate .\nthe structure in reduced units ( @xmath47 ) is predicted to be invariant along an isomorph ( paper iv ) .\nthe excess entropy , @xmath48 , depends only on structure and was shown in paper iv also to be invariant along an isomorph ( here and henceforth `` excess '' refers to the quantity in question in excess to that of an ideal gas with same density and temperature ) . in the below simulations we generate an isomorph as a set of state points in the phase diagram with constant @xmath49 . to change density and temperature keeping @xmath49 constant ,\nthe following identity is used ( paper iv ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and a maxwell relation was applied . utilizing the standard fluctuation formulae this leads ( paper iv ) to :    @xmath52    the procedure applied to generate isomorphs\nnumerically can be summarized as : 1 ) an equilibrium @xmath2 simulation was performed at a given state point ;

( [ eq : scaled_u ] ) with eqs .\n( [ eq : u ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) we obtain a parametric description of an isomorph in the @xmath3 phase diagram : @xmath92 once the numbers @xmath93 and @xmath94 have been determined from a reference state point using eqs .

for instance one particular isomorph will be characterized by 53% liquid and 47% crystal , etc . in the pressure - temperature phase diagram\nthese `` coexistence '' isomorphs collapse into one .\nthe prediction that the melting line , both slightly to the liquid side and slightly to the solid side , are isomorphs has a number of consequences and it sheds new light on well - known phenomenological melting rules ( as well as exceptions to these rules for non - strongly correlating liquids , paper iv ) .\nthus , for instance the observation that the lindemann melting criterion is pressure independent for a given liquid follows from the isomorph property of the melting line ( whereas the existence of a universal lindemann criterion does not follow ) . indeed , as is easy to show from paper iv the isomorph theory implies ross `` generalized lindemann melting law '' from 1969 @xcite , according to which the reduced configurational partition function of the crystalline phase @xmath125 $ ] is invariant along the melting line ( here @xmath1 is the potential energy , @xmath126 is the potential energy of the crystal with all atoms located exactly at their lattice sites , and the tilde denotes reduced coordinates .\nfurther well - known melting rules , which the isomorph theory explains , include ( paper iv ) : the reduced viscosity , the reduced surface tension , the reduced diffusion constant , and the reduced heat conductivity are all invariant in the liquid phase along the melting line .\nlikewise , the reduced - unit static structure factor is invariant along the melting curve .\nthese rules have been confirmed for several liquids in both experiment and simulation ( see references of paper v ) .    like other isomorph predictions following from eq .\n( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) , the prediction that solid - liquid coexistence curves are isomorphs is only expected to be exact for systems that obey eq .\n( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) exactly , i.e. , perfectly correlating systems .\nindeed , it straightforward to show that in ipl systems the phase behavior depends only on @xmath127 , and thus the co - existence line is an ( exact ) isomorph .\nthe interesting question now is : how well do strongly correlating systems , e.g. , generalized lj systems , follow the prediction ? note that we do not expect the liquid - gas co - existence lines to be isomorphs ( and indeed they are not ) ; the gas - phase is not strongly correlating and thus eq .\n( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) can not be fulfilled in the relevant part of configuration space .\nin contrast , at the solid - liquid coexistence both phases involved are strongly correlating for lj systems ( paper i ) , and we thus in the following test to what degree the isomorph prediction is fulfilled .\nahmed and sadus used in a recent paper @xcite a novel numerical method for determining solid - liquid coexistence .\nthey reported results for the generalized lj potential with the repulsive exponent @xmath19 varying from 12 to 7 and fixed attractive exponent @xmath61 ( ahmed and sadus termed the repulsive exponent @xmath31 , not @xmath19 ; we keep , however , the above notation ) .\nfigure [ fig : uwcoexist_lin ] shows the state points reported by ahmed and sadus for the liquid side of the solid - liquid coexistence curve compared to the isomorphic predictions as expressed in eqs .\n( [ eq : isomorphu_lin ] ) and ( [ eq : isomorphw_lin ] ) .\nthe lower panel shows that the parameters found by fitting to eqs .\n( [ eq : isomorphu_lin ] ) and ( [ eq : isomorphw_lin ] ) respectively are consistent .\nfigure  [ fig : uwcoexist ] shows the same data plotting , respectively , potential energy ( left panel ) and virial ( right panel ) versus density .\nfigure [ fig : uwcoexistphase ] shows the 12 - 6 lj solid - liqud phase behavior in the wu - diagram and in the @xmath128-diagram ( inset ) , including here also data from mastny and de pablo.@xcite    the prediction that solid - liquid coexistence lines are isomorphs agrees well on the liquid side with the simulation results of ahmed and sadus@xcite as well as with the results for 12 - 6 lj from mastny and de pablo@xcite . on the solid side\nthe agreement is less convincing ( see fig .  [\nfig : uwcoexistphase ] ) ; in particular the logarithmic derivative in the @xmath128 diagram ( slope in the inset ) differs by 25% . at present\nwe do not have an explanation for this .\nit might be related to inter - particle distances longer than the first peak of the radial distribution function playing a bigger role for the phase behavior on the solid side@xcite than on the liquid side .    ) ) plotting potential energy versus @xmath129 on isochores for the systems investigated in fig .\n[ fig : uwischores ] . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]     phase diagram using @xmath130 as reference density .\ncurves and lines : theoretical predictions ( eqs .\n( [ eq : ustar ] ) to ( [ eq : isomorph_scaling_w ] ) ) for three isochores , an isomorph , and an isotherm .\ndata points : simulations of the 12 - 6 kablj mixture .\nthe parameters of the equation of state were found from the two state points indicated by circles , giving @xmath131 . by comparison , the corresponding parameters found by fitting to the @xmath130 isochore in figs .\n[ fig : uwischores ] and [ fig : urosenfeld ] are @xmath132 , illustrating the robustness of the fitted equation of state . applying the fitting procedure to the simulated state points on the @xmath133 isotherm\ngives the parameters ( 38.5 , 5.19 , -8.63 , 2.61 ) .\nlower panel : same data as above in a @xmath134 diagram . ,\ntitle=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   phase diagram using @xmath130 as reference density .\ncurves and lines : theoretical predictions ( eqs .\n( [ eq : ustar ] ) to ( [ eq : isomorph_scaling_w ] ) ) for three isochores , an isomorph , and an isotherm .\ndata points : simulations of the 12 - 6 kablj mixture .\nthe parameters of the equation of state were found from the two state points indicated by circles , giving @xmath131 . by comparison ,\nthe corresponding parameters found by fitting to the @xmath130 isochore in figs .

iii ) .\nfigure  [ fig : urosenfeld ] tests the rosenfeld - tarazona prediction for the systems investigated in fig .\n[ fig : uwischores ] .\nthe prediction works very well , but less so for the supercooled wahnstrm blj system , for which the formation of extended `` frank - kasper '' clusters at low temperatures affects the temperature dependence of the potential energy . @xcite    combining eq .\n( [ eq : urosenfeld ] ) with our results on isomorphs and isochores we can construct an equation of state for generalized lj systems .\nthe idea is to map any state point @xmath138 to the corresponding isomorphic state point @xmath137 on a reference isochore ( where it is implecitely understood that the parameters ( @xmath143 ) are evaluated at the reference isochore @xmath144 ) : @xmath145 from ( @xmath146 ) we can calculate the contribution to the potential energy from the two ipl terms of the potential ( compare eqs .\n( [ eq : um ] ) and([eq : un ] ) ) : @xmath147 finally , we use isomorphic scaling ( eqs .\n( [ eq : isomorphu ] ) and ( [ eq : isomorphw ] ) ) to go back to the @xmath138 state point : @xmath148 the new equation of state given by eqs .\n( [ eq : umseos ] ) to ( [ eq : isomorph_scaling_w ] ) contains four parameters ( @xmath143 ) evaluated at a reference density @xmath144 .\nthe parameters can be calculated from @xmath149 , and @xmath150 at a single state point . a more convenient way of estimating the parameters might be : for a collection of @xmath138 state points , at least two of which are non - isomorphic , use isomorphic scaling ( eqs .\n( [ eq : isomorphu])and  ( [ eq : isomorphw ] ) ) to get the corresponding @xmath101 at the chosen reference density , and fit them to eq .\n( [ eq : wisochor ] ) to determine @xmath151 and @xmath53 .\nnext , using the fitted value for @xmath53 , fit to eq .\n( [ eq : ustar ] ) in order to find @xmath152 and @xmath153 .    to put the new equation of state to a test\n, the procedure described above was used to determine the four parameters ( @xmath143 ) for the 12 - 6 kablj system using merely two state points .\nthe resulting equation of state is shown as full lines in fig .\n[ fig : uwstate ] , where it is compared to simulation results shown as data points .\nthe agreement is good .\nthe largest deviations are seen when changing density away from the reference density , most evident for the isotherm in the @xmath3 diagram and the isomorph in the @xmath134 diagram .\nbetter agreement is expected if the density dependence of @xmath53 is taken into account , but such a correction will not be attempted here . to summarize , combining the isomorph theory with two further approximations , a state - point independent exponent @xmath53 and the rosenfeld - tarazona expression , a realistic equation of state with four parameters is arrived at .\npaper iv demonstrated that strongly correlating liquids have isomorphs , i.e. , curves in the phase diagram along which structure and dynamics to a good approximation are invariant in reduced units .\nthe main new results in this paper are predictions specific to generalized lennard - jones systems and the supporting numerical evidence .    starting from the invariance of structure along isomorphs , a prediction for the shape of these in the @xmath3 phase diagram was presented and shown to agree well with simulation results .\nit was shown that for a given system , the isomorphs all have the same shape in the @xmath3 phase diagram ; they are simply scaled versions of each other .\nfurthermore , the isomorph shape depends only on the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath31 , i.e. , all systems with , say , 12 - 6 lj interactions have same isomorphs in the @xmath3 phase diagram .\nwhat differs from system to system is the values of the density and temperature along an isomorph .    throughout papers i\n- v the @xmath3 phase diagram was referred to extensively .\nthis particular phase diagram has not been used much before , but it is evident that for strongly correlating liquids several features stand out when presented in the @xmath3 phase diagram .\nprominent examples are that isochores are straight lines ( with slope @xmath53 ) and the existence of the `` master '' isomorph discussed above for generalized lj systems .\nthe class of strongly correlating liquids includes , we believe , all van der waals liquids and metallic liquids ( but excludes hydrogen - bonding , covalent , as well as strongly ionic liquids ) .\nmore simulations , as well as experiments , are needed to substantiate that the class of strongly correlating liquids is this large , but preliminary simulations of simple molecular models like@xcite the asymmetric dumbbell and the lewis - wahnstrom otp three - site model are encouraging .\nin particular , the isomorph properties of more complex molecule models need to be simulated , as well as theoretically contemplated ; the scaling properties of molecules with fixed bond lengths are not trivial .\nit should be noted that even a quite complex system like a phospholipid membrane can be strongly correlating with respect to its slow degrees of freedom,@xcite the interactions of which are dominated by van der waals forces .\nanother interesting question is to study in detail the properties of liquids where the exponent @xmath53 varies significantly throughout the phase diagram , for instance the weeks - chandler - andersen cutoff variant of the generalized binary lj liquid that was recently investigated om detail by coslovich and roland , @xcite as well as berthier and tarjus.@xcite another system that deserves further investigation is the 200 - 100 lj system@xcite which we find to be an exception to the general observation that generalized lj systems are strongly correlating  presumably as a consequence of its extremely narrow range of interactions .\nthis series of papers investigated in depth the properties of strongly correlating liquids .\nwe believe to have demonstrated that strongly correlating liquids are simpler than liquids in general .\nhopefully this insight will turn out to be useful in furthering the understanding of the properties of liquids in general .\nacknowledgments + urp is supported by the danish council for independent research in natural sciences .\nthe center for viscous liquid dynamics `` glass and time '' is sponsored by the danish national research foundation ( dnrf ) .\nunless stated otherwise , simulations are performed using a newly developed molecular dynamics code optimized for nvidia graphics cards .\nthe code is available as open source at http://rumd.org .\npotentials were cut and shifted at @xmath154 . reported potentials and virials do not include contributions beyond the cut -
