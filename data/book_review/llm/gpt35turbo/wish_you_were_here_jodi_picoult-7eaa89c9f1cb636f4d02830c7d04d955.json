Try to include only information that was present in the given reviews, and do not invent new information about the book.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Wish You Were Here [Jodi Picoult]\n\nDescription: This book took my breath away, making me terrified, scared, shaking me to the core: I’m overwhelmed because of dealing with complex feelings at the same time: sadness, amusement, excitement, stress, worry,anxiousness…\n\nIt’s another Sliding Doors theme: where you could be and what kind of situations you may deal with if you make different choices about your life in the middle of pandemic.\n\nThis is philosophical, metal psychical and psychological novel about how human lives evolve, how they change, how adapt in new normal but mostly it’s about how to stay alive and protect our sanity when all hell breaks loose?\n\nDiane O’Toole, associate assistant at Sotheby’s, living with her surgical resident boyfriend Finn in NYC, mapped out her entire life with him: the house they live, the children they have, the bucket list trips they go, the retirement plans etc.\n\nNearly four years they saved up for Galapagos trip they planned: this is the best time for Diane because legendary Kitomi Ito ( quiet twin of Yoko Ono) decided to postpone the auction of the famous Toulouse - Lautrec painting she owned because of uprising of contagious virus. This auction of masterpiece could bring the promotion to Diane, she’s working so hard for.\n\nBut she is still keeping her hopes up: because she found a ring is hidden inside Finn’s socks. This means he’s planning to propose on their vacation and she’s going to say: yes! She’s gonna celebrate her 30th birthday as an engaged woman.\n\nWell, when they made plans, God laughed and eventually Finn admits: it’s all hands on deck at the hospital: the COVID cases start to hit NYC faster than they imagine. So he offers her to go alone and interestingly she accepts!\n\nBut as soon as she gets off the plane she realizes her baggage is missing and that’s not the only predicament she has to face. When she gets off the ferry to walk to her hotel, she realizes her hotel is closed and for two weeks the entire island is shut down for quarantine.\n\nThankfully a local woman provides her a house to stay, leaving traditional food at her kitchen. But Diane gets herself trapped in an island without knowing the langue islanders talk, failing to obey the curfew times, dealing with the hostile manners of a mysterious, charismatic man and her cash is about to run out at this place which doesn’t have any ATM machines. Did I also tell you there’s no proper internet connection! She starts writing postcards to communicate with Finn but the post office is also close. How will she send them?\n\nBut her fate crosses with this charismatic mysterious man and his daughter which probably change her entire vision and perspective about the island!\n\nI’m not giving more spoilers! But i can only say that in the middle of the book, I dropped my e-reader and I screamed WTH!\n\nAfter shocking, jaw dropping revelation later, thankfully we didn’t have a bumpy ride. The emotional approach of the story and fair- satisfying ending made me smile a lot. I think I can give 10 stars for the heartfelt, earth shattering ending! It’s like last epic scene of remarkable movie!\n\nThis book realistically tells us the terrifying and ugly face of COVID- 19. Especially Finn’s emails draw dark, compelling, horrifying and also honest depictions about how the entire medical professionals are fighting against the lethal disease. It makes you remind of respecting them so deeply! They are the real heroes who saved our lives and gave us hope to hold on for so long!\n\nJodi Picoult is amazing storyteller: reflecting the dark face of tragedy we’ve been confronting nearly 1 and half years. She also depicted the perfect pictures of Galapagos. She told us a story of a girl who planned everything to choose different path from her mother she resented for abandoning her. But she also told how to open our hearts and forgive each other to be free from our resentments.\n\nI extremely loved this book so much ! I think this is one of the best works of the author. I liked Dante ( Tenth Circle is her another book focused on Dante’s Inferno), Tiger King ( I agree she is guilty), Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by natural selection references!\n\nThis is one of the books you want to reread at different parts and timelines of your life. Annie’s inner journey will stay in your mind forever and eventually it will encourage you to start your inner journey to find out what you want to do with one and precious life of yours!\n\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group / Ballantine Books for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Wish You Were Here [Jodi Picoult]\n\nDescription: Of all the books I have read this year, I cannot think of any that will resonate so deeply with a global audience as this one. Jodi Picoult carries out an impressive level of research for her oh so human look at the pain, losses, lockdown, heartbreak, grief, loneliness and isolation experienced by people as the horrifying nightmare of Covid-19 took hold and shut down so much of the world. I can understand if this is too soon for many readers to read about, but I found this to be an absolutely riveting read, highlighting the incredibly courageous work of the frontline medical staff, whilst providing an insightful glimpse into the beauty and nature of the Galapagos Islands, its people, history and culture.\n\nIn New York, the ambitious Diana O'Toole is almost thirty, and on the verge of achieving all that she wants professionally as an art specialist at Sotheby's, and personally, convinced that Finn Colson, a surgical resident at the Presbyterian hospital will propose on a trip to Galapagos to celebrate her 30th birthday. However, her carefully planned life is about to be shot into tiny pieces when Finn is unable to go with her as a medical emergency develops with the beginnings of the Covid-19 virus. Diana arrives on Galapagos as it is going into quarantine and lockdown, leaving her stranded, her luggage is lost, she cannot speak the language, and communications are patchy. She is isolated and lonely, but finds herself connecting with a local family. Like so many people, Diana is to find herself re-evaluating her sense of identity and working out what really matters in life.\n\nThere is a humdinger of a ingenious twist that Picoult weaves into the narrative that I cannot reveal as it will be entering into spoiler territory. This is one of the author's best works, it is multi-layered, the characters are stellar and feel so authentic, and whilst it does not make for easy reading, I found myself turning the pages as fast as I could. Ultimately, this is a emotionally poignant, thought provoking novel, of what it is to be human, and the love, resilence, bravery and hope in the face of a global pandemic that broke so many lives. I think so many readers will love and appreciate this book. Highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Wish You Were Here [Jodi Picoult]\n\nDescription: Hmm, this is a tough one to review.\n\nIn the end, I liked what Jodi Picoult did with Wish You Were Here. I like that she took it in, let's say, unexpected directions, and explored a subject I knew very little about. I did not predict the way this story would unfold. Which is good.\n\nThat being said, I found the first half of this book very slow. Diana finds herself alone in the Galápagos islands, her boyfriend thousands of miles away fighting to save people from COVID in the emergency room, when the island is put on lockdown. With no way to get home, Diana wanders around being a bit of an ignorant tourist, meeting the locals, and trying to find a way to feed herself.\n\nDiana becomes involved in the lives of local businessman, Gabriel, and his daughter, Beatriz. Through these new friendships and interactions, she begins to question what she had thought she wanted from her life, to question the path she is on and whether it is the right one. This goes on for more than half of the book (192 pages in the e-arc). I was not enamoured by it.\n\nAs I said earlier, though, the book does go on to take some interesting turns. It's unfortunate that what I liked about the book would reveal too much, so I can only really talk about my complaints here.\n\nIt's rewarding for the patient reader.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Wish You Were Here [Jodi Picoult]\n\nDescription: 4.5 stars\nWow, I'm not sure how to put into words what I just read.\n\nI will start off with a bit of a warning. If you're not in a place where you can read about the experiences of Covid from many different angles, then I'd recommend you steer clear of this one for a while. The trauma of the pandemic is very real, and the author does an incredibly good job of conveying it to the reader in a visceral way.\n\nI have not read a book by Picoult in years. I became disenchanted with her issues-driven writing that always felt like it had an agenda. I suppose this one is similar, but it doesn't seem to be forcing things down my throat. I had seen so many stellar reviews for it that I took the chance to pick this one up and wasn't disappointed.\n\nIt takes a LOT to surprise me. I maybe read one or two books a year that truly knock me off kilter with a surprise. This one might be my one for the year.\n\nThis book features Diana, an art acquisition specialist at Sotheby's with a long term boyfriend, Finn, who is a surgical resident. The two are planning a bucket list trip to the Galapagos in March of 2020, and Diana found an engagement ring hidden in the dresser so she is pretty sure Finn will propose during the trip. Yet Covid has begun to hit New York City with a vengeance, and Finn has to stay and work, it is all hands on deck. He encourages Diana to go on the trip without him and she reluctantly agrees. As soon as she arrives on the small island, the world goes into lockdown and she's unable to return home. Communication is spotty. She gradually gets to know some of the residents of the island, and becomes very close to them.\n\nThe book is so much more complex than my short synopsis can convey. There are parental abandonment issues, re-examination of life choices, and myriad other issues that the pandemic brought to the surface for many, if not all of us. The reason I didn't rate this a full five stars was because I didn't really like Diana most of the time (sometimes she is sympathetic, but other times she is very selfish) and I hate infidelity in any form. I get that she was struggling being so isolated and far away, but to me it isn't an excuse and so a half of a star taken away for that.\n\nHowever this book overall is incredibly insightful and thought provoking, as well has having a jaw dropping moment that I won't forget anytime soon. If anything, this book should make everyone really think about the choices we make in life and why we are making those choices. The pandemic has allowed many of us to reassess what is truly important in our lives. This is a meaty book, filled with emotion and anguish, and like I said at the beginning, it's not a book for everyone at this time. I really appreciated the author's note at the end and it gave me so much perspective about the choices that the author made in her writing of this novel.\n\nThis would make a fantastic book club choice, there's a lot here that begs to be discussed and dissected.\n\nEdited to add: I think she missed a golden opportunity to add an Easter egg here and call the singing group the Scarabs or something beetle related rather than bird related.\n\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Wish You Were Here [Jodi Picoult]\n\nDescription: Diana O’Toole, an associate specialist for Sotheby’s auction house, has her perfect life in NYC with surgical resident, Finn, mapped out - all that’s missing is the proposal and wedding, and she’s pretty sure she’s about to get the former on their romantic vacation to the Galapagos. When the initial wave of COVID hits and Finn is needed at the hospital, Diana goes solo and finds herself trapped longer than expected by travel restrictions. What she discovers during and after this extended vacation opens her eyes and makes her re-evaluate the future she’s envisioned.\n\nI’ve learned something about myself after finishing this book:\n\nI think I’m broken. Looking around at all my friends’ glowing reviews for this, I have to wonder why I didn’t feel those things too.\n\nLet me start with some things Jodi Picoult did so well in this book, though, because she deserves credit where it’s due:\n\nFirst: This woman researched the hell out of the major aspects of COVID-19 from transmission to its after effects and it SHOWS. Many won’t be ready for such an unflinching, no-holds-barred look at this virus, but if you ever feel ready to look at it more closely in the relative safety of a fictionalized story, this is your book. It’s difficult and sobering at times, but it’s also terribly insightful and honest, and I can respect that. I learned a lot that I didn’t know, and I think it’s a tremendous learning opportunity for those who want it.\n\nSecond: She writes very well. Structure, plot, fully-developed characters, pacing, atmosphere, the big twist, which was so clever … it’s all there. It’s perfectly good fiction, and it will appeal to many readers, as evidenced by all those aforementioned glowing reviews.\n\nSo why didn’t it work as well for me?\n\nFirst: The story felt forced. COVID-19 was really the body of the book, so to speak, and Diana’s story was just the clothing thrown on to disguise it. Picoult had all this knowledge about the virus to share, but it felt much better suited for a non-fiction book. Finn’s emails to Diana were just woefully unrealistic to me. Not the detailed names of medicines, machines and interventions used on patients - that was highly factual, but given their circumstances of being separated for so long, it didn’t feel like this is what he’d be spending all his time writing the love of his life about.\n\nSecond: Despite the reasoning for Diana’s decision-making and conclusions, I couldn’t get onboard with it. I can’t really discuss it for spoiler reasons, but it didn’t ring true to me, and I really didn't like the ending. She just didn't make sense to me.\n\nThird: The first half of the book was - there’s no way to put this politely - kind of boring. Maybe that was intentional on the author’s part to put the reader back in the mindset of the early days of the pandemic when everything was shut down and we were spending our days struggling to find things to do, but this reader wasn’t ready to revisit those days and how the world felt then.\n\nAs I said, it’s a well-written book with an abundance of 4 and 5-star reviews, so I encourage you to read some of those before deciding whether the book is for you. It’s simply a case of right book, wrong reader for me.\n\n★★★ ½\n\nThanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, NetGalley and author Jodi Picoult for this ARC in exchange for my honest opinions.
