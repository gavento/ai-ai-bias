It's a dreamy reading journey for bookworms who love to lose themselves in a well-written story.\n\nThis book shattered me. It awakened so many different feelings in me that I didn’t know I had. But one thing is for sure: I haven't cried so hard in a long time! The characters Backman created will hold a special place in my heart forever!\n\nNow I can hardly enjoy any other books in comparison to \"We are Winners\"! I don't have enough words to describe how much I love this book!\n\nI was surprised when I found out the third book in the Beartown series was coming out! I thought all my favorite characters' stories had concluded, including Peter, Ramona, Maya, Anna, Benji, Amat, Bobo, and Kira… I couldn't have been more wrong!\n\nThere was more to tell, especially with that ominous opening that warned us that something extremely ominous would rip our hearts apart! I just read the words and started to scream, \"No!!\" Those words were about the fate of one of my favorite characters in this book. Tears had already started to drip down my face, my fists clenched. This was shocking, this was sad, but I couldn't stop reading! I owed it to my favorite characters to go on!\n\nI kept reading because this book is not only about loss and grief; it's about the power of darkness, how it takes control of ordinary people, how grudges and anger can force people to do things beyond their control. It's about how good people can be capable of great evil, and how evil people can be capable of great good.\n\nThis book is about corruption, abuse, rape, politics, power, money, hypocrisy, and pure rage! But it's also about the eternal flame of friendship, doing wrong things to do the right thing, love, parenthood, community, hockey, second chances, and, most importantly, forgiveness, paying your dues, and embracing your community, family, and loved ones!\n\nWe thought it was a chivalrous move when Peter left his position at the hockey club to work with his wife, Kira. We couldn't have been more wrong! Peter struggles. He bakes bread to feed the emptiness growing inside of him. He misses being someone, the plays, the manager. He even misses being a father after Maya left the house. Kira struggles too. She works more, has financial problems, and keeps secrets from her husband.\n\nWe thought Maya saved her soul with her music. Yes, she left the town two years ago, just like her rapist did. Leaving town and memories behind to find a new home and studying music didn't fix Maya! She still suffers, still lives with the haunted night, still feels the pain Kevin gave her over and over again.\n\nWe thought Amat was over the moon after becoming the star of the hockey team. Nope! He's suffering. There are rumors that he failed at NFL meetings, he's faking his injury, and he's not going to be a member of the team anymore. He's a useless drunk who hates himself.\n\nAnd Benji… he left town for good like Maya did. But is he having the time of his life? He escaped to Asia because Asian people weren't interested in hockey. So he aimed to be a nobody, getting skinnier, running away from attachments, drifting apart.\n\nBobo became the assistant coach, still hopeful for Amat's return to the rinks, trying to woo a Hed girl with his cooking skills.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we see the characters facing their own demons and struggles while also dealing with the new challenges that arise. The plot twists and turns, leaving the reader constantly guessing what will happen next.\n\nOne of the most powerful themes of the book is the idea of redemption and forgiveness. Many of the characters have made mistakes in the past, but they are given a chance to make amends and start fresh. Backman shows us that even the most broken people can find a way to heal and move forward.\n\nAnother important theme is the idea of community and the power of coming together to support one another. The characters in the book may have their differences, but when they are faced with a crisis, they all come together to help each other out. It's a powerful message about the importance of putting aside our differences and working towards a common goal.\n\nOverall, \"We Are the Winners\" is a powerful and moving book that will stay with readers long after they've finished reading it. Backman's writing is masterful, and he creates characters that are so real and relatable that it's impossible not to feel for them. This is a book that will make you laugh, cry, and ultimately leave you feeling inspired.\n\nMillions of thanks to Ariele Fredman, NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this AMAZING digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Winners [Fredrik Backman]\n\nDescription: there are stories that make you feel everything. and then there are stories that leave you empty.\n\nthis story is both.\n\nand its all because of benji.\n\nif you have read the previous two books in the beartown series, your heart will already belong to him. you will know the boy with the sad eyes and the wild heart. you will know the kind of person he is.\n\ni really wish this book had kept its original title ‘those who run towards fire,’ because thats benji. hes the sort of person who runs toward a fire. no hesitation, no questions, he just runs. people like that are rare, but you know who they are when you see them. and those of you who know benji probably knew deep down that he was never the sort of person who would get a happy ending.\n\nobviously we still hoped. oh, how we hoped.\n\nthis final book, this ending, benjis ending, hurts too much to touch with words.\n\nbut thank you, fredrik backman, for giving it to us all the same.\n\nmy endless gratitude for the ARC, atria books.\n\n↠ 5 stars\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Winners [Fredrik Backman]\n\nDescription: I love Fredrik Backman and have read everything he has written!! I loved “Beartown” and enjoyed it immensely, I thought it was a complete book on its own. Then I read “Us Against You'' and it was just alright for me, there were some new highlights and I was good with it.\n\nWhen I saw that Mr. Backman had a third book out, of course I grabbed it. I wish I would have checked the length of the book first, at 688 pages this is a LOT of book to get through.\n\nI’m going to do a Pros and Cons on this one because my thoughts are all over the place and if you love this book – don’t read on, and please don’t hate me.\n\nPROS:\nThe characters are wonderful and I loved seeing them again.\n\nI really enjoyed the storm and liked that it started with a bang!! I wish he would have played with this tension and kept it going because I didn’t feel it.\n\nThe setting is so well described it actually made me feel claustrophobic, but I could relate to the snowstorm. I enjoyed watching everyone coming together to help each other – this is the side of the town that I always loved.\n\nCONS:\nSeriously I don’t think we needed a book #3. Instead of feeling all excited to see what was coming next, the book is bogged down in repetition. Repetition of what the characters went through before – which I already knew. Repetition of how the two towns HATED EACH OTHER!!\n\nI’m going to just say it – THE BOOK WAS TOO LONG!! These characters must be so special to Mr. Backman that he felt he needed to tie everything up. He is a master storyteller, but at almost 700 pages I was definitely skimming pages to get to the end.\n\nI was incredibly tired of the politics, the scheming, the money involved in building the new club, etc etc etc. I’m calling it BEARTOWN BURNOUT!!\n\nI know small towns, we have so many in my state. I know they love their local baseball, basketball or whatever teams – it’s fun. However I didn’t feel much fun here, either being had by the players, their families or those watching the games. Surely they must have other things in their life?? I just didn’t buy it, I’m probably wrong and there is a town just like this somewhere in Sweden. If there is, I hope that they learn to love other things besides hockey – because that’s a pretty narrow life, isn’t it??\n\nI will always be a Fredrik Backman fan, this one just didn’t move me as his others have.\n\nI received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Winners [Fredrik Backman]\n\nDescription: It took me a while to catch my breath in the end, to absorb all that happened in this third and final book of the Beartown series. If you are a fan of the first two books, I suspect you will want to know what happened now that two years have passed since what happened to Maya, what happened in this town, to these families, to these characters - Benji, Ana, Ramona, Maya, Bobo, Peter, Amat, Sune and others and you will welcome the new characters. I had to know and for me this is the best of the three.\n\nI lived in the Swedish forest towns of Beartown and Hed once again. These are hockey towns and I’m not even a hockey fan, but these stories are about so much more than hockey . These stories are about family, friendships, community, about people’s flaws and strengths. They are about tragedies, about loss, about the ties that bind people during hard times, about tough politics, about some bad actors, too . They are a slice of life in small Swedish towns, near the forest, where hockey reigns and shapes daily life. But the things that happen here can happen anywhere - drugs, alcohol , deaths, rape and sexual violence, dysfunctional families, troubled marriages. This is not an easy book to read. I was gutted at times. Thankfully, there are genuine friendships, and love and even though that doesn’t erase the pain, it somehow makes it a little easier to bear.\n\nI can’t say that the book was perfect. The parts about the corruption, the politics, the sponsors, the schemes to save the teams, the towns was a bit much at times and honestly confusing. Having said that, the strength of this story lies in Backman’s keen observation of human nature, his empathy for the human condition and in creating characters that I loved. I was grateful to know what happens to them and how their lives will be in the future. I didn’t realize how much I missed these characters until I started reading this book . Now that the Beartown trilogy has ended I miss them even more. It’s hard to say goodbye to characters that you love, but it won’t be goodbye because they will be with me for a long time. That in itself is worthy of all the stars.\n\nI received an advanced copy of this book from Atria Books through NetGalley.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Winners [Fredrik Backman]\n\nDescription: 5 stars for the characters, 3 stars for the plot\n\n“This hurts too much to touch with words.”\n\nThe Winners is the conclusion to the Beartown saga. In this installment, someone dies, a celebrated hero returns, and a little girl becomes the symbol of hope for a town devastated by a violent act.\n\nThere is no point in reading The Winners if you haven’t read Beartownand Us Against You.\n\nThis wasn’t a lovefest for me. Coming in at a little under 700 pages, this book was too long-- parts were repetitive, and some of the storylines were dragged out, whereas others were not given enough attention. It is an understatement to say that the narrative was uneven.\n\nSimilar to books one and two, the narrative alternated between characters, with many allusions to the past and future. Backman likes to highlight connections, from the obvious to the minute, which made this a slow and tedious read.\n\nI didn’t love the first half, and there were even times that I had to force myself to continue reading. While I loved reuniting with the characters, it was a long ride to get to the end.\n\nBut my love for the characters kept me reading. They are the best part of this series. I think I love them a little too much!\n\nThe last 20% filled me with dread. I knew what was coming, but I refused to believe it. This part of the book is also the heart of the book, as readers have to say goodbye. After finishing this book, I am an emotional mess. Saying goodbye to these characters was harder than I thought.\n\nThe journey to get there was long and harrowing but worth it in the end. This series has touched my heart, and the characters have made a mark. As hard as the ending was to read, it was, in essence, perfect.\n\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Atria Books in exchange for an honest review."
