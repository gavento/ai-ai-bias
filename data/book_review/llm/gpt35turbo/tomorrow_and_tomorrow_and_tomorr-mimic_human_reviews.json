It explores themes of friendship, love, and the complexities of human relationships. The characters, particularly Sadie and Sam, are well-developed and flawed, making them relatable and intriguing. However, their constant cycle of friendship and falling out can be tiresome at times.\n\nAuthor Gabrielle Zevin's writing is dense and filled with obscure words, which may not appeal to all readers. Additionally, the occasional use of second-person narrative and the integration of video game worlds into the story may be polarizing for some. The length of the book, 416 pages, can also make it feel like a daunting read.\n\nAs someone who is not a gamer, I found myself occasionally lost in the video game references and terminology. However, this did not hinder my overall enjoyment of the book. Zevin's exploration of gaming culture and the gaming industry was fascinating and educational. The blending of reality and virtual worlds was done in a creative and thought-provoking manner.\n\nDespite its flaws, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a well-written and original novel that leaves a lasting impact. The emotional moments and the depth of the characters make it a book that will stay with readers long after they finish it. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate coming-of-age stories and are open to exploring the world of video games will find this book to be a worthwhile read.\n\nNote: I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",
        "Title: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: A Deep Dive into the World of Gaming\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a unique and intricate novel that explores the world of video games, friendship, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\nThe story revolves around Sadie and Sam, two childhood friends who bond over their shared love of video games. As the narrative spans three decades, readers witness the ups and downs of their friendship, including romantic entanglements and personal struggles. The author, Gabrielle Zevin, skillfully weaves together the real world and the virtual worlds created by Sadie and Sam, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.\n\nZevin's writing style is captivating and immersive, keeping readers engaged throughout the 416 pages.

The dynamics of their friendship are both endearing and frustrating, reflecting the complexities of real-life relationships. Supporting characters such as Sam's mother, Anna, and Sadie's professor, Dov, also leave a lasting impact.\n\nWhile the novel delves into the world of gaming, readers do not need to be gamers themselves to appreciate the story. Zevin's detailed descriptions and references to popular games and gaming culture provide an immersive experience for both avid gamers and those less familiar with the subject matter. The inclusion of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references adds an extra layer of nostalgia and enjoyment.\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a thought-provoking and original novel that lingers in the minds of readers long after the final page. Zevin's exploration of friendship, love, and the human experience through the lens of gaming is both refreshing and memorable.

        "Title: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: An Ambitious Exploration of Friendship and Gaming\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a novel that delves into the intricate world of friendship and gaming. The story follows Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives revolve around their shared passion for video games. As the narrative unfolds over the course of three decades, author Gabrielle Zevin skillfully intertwines the real and virtual worlds, creating a captivating tale that keeps readers engrossed from start to finish.\n\nZevin's writing prowess is evident in her ability to make a seemingly niche topic like video games come alive. Despite my initial reservations, I found myself completely absorbed in the lives of Sadie and Sam. The depth and complexity of their characters, coupled with the author's masterful storytelling, made them the most compelling protagonists I have encountered in recent memory.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that this novel may not be for everyone. Zevin's use of obscure vocabulary and risky narrative techniques, such as occasional second-person chapters and immersive video game sequences, may be off-putting to some readers. Additionally, the plot touches on dark and unsettling themes, which may not resonate with everyone. At 416 pages, the book demands a significant time commitment, but the reward is a rich and fulfilling reading experience.\n\nHaving previously enjoyed Zevin's other works, I was pleasantly surprised by the departure from her usual style. Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow showcases the author's versatility and ability to tackle diverse subjects with equal finesse. While her previous novels were akin to quick and satisfying meals, this book is a literary feast that demands to be savored.\n\nIn conclusion, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has earned a permanent spot on my all-time favorites shelf.

Gabrielle Zevin's storytelling prowess shines through as she takes readers on a journey spanning almost thirty years, following the lives of Sadie and Sam, two friends whose bond is forged through their shared passion for gaming.\n\nZevin's ability to capture the essence of her characters is truly remarkable.

The dynamics of their friendship, the highs and lows they encounter, and the challenges they face are all portrayed with a raw authenticity that tugs at the heartstrings.\n\nWhile the novel revolves around video games, it manages to transcend the gaming world and delve into deeper themes of love, jealousy, ambition, and the human experience. Zevin seamlessly weaves together the virtual and real worlds, creating a narrative that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.\n\nIt is worth noting that this book may not be for everyone. Zevin's use of obscure words and risky writing techniques, such as second-person chapters and immersive descriptions of video game worlds, may be off-putting for some readers.

        "Title: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: A Complex and Tedious Exploration of Video Game Culture\n\nWhile Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow delves into the world of video games and the complex friendship between Sadie and Sam, I found myself disappointed by the overall execution of the story. As a fan of Zevin's previous works, I was eager to be enchanted by this book, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.\n\nThe novel revolves around the lives of Sadie and Sam, two individuals who share a deep love for video games. While their friendship evolves and intertwines throughout the narrative, the story also touches upon various themes such as family dynamics, sexism in the gaming industry, and abusive relationships. Zevin's exploration of these topics is commendable, but the tediousness of the plot overshadowed the moments of brilliance.\n\nAs someone who doesn't consider myself a dedicated gamer, I struggled to maintain interest in a story so heavily centered around video game culture. While I could appreciate the historical and cultural references, I found myself constantly searching for distractions rather than fully immersing myself in the narrative.\n\nDespite the length of the book being a mere 400 pages, it felt much longer due to the slow pacing and lack of engaging moments. The constant interruptions and disinterest I experienced while reading made it difficult to connect with the characters and their experiences.\n\nThat being said, I can acknowledge the well-developed characters and the thought-provoking nature of the novel. Zevin successfully tackles important themes and provides depth to her characters, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to sustain my interest.\n\nOverall, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow may appeal to avid gamers and those with a deep appreciation for video game culture. However, for readers like myself who do not consider gaming a defining aspect of their lives, the book may prove to be a tedious and unengaging read. While I can recognize the author's intentions and the potential impact of the story, it ultimately fell short of my expectations."

In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.\n\nIt must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.\n\nThey are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.\n\nI do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.\n\nAlso, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.\n\nI feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?\n\nMy sincere thanks to the author and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the gifted review copy via NetGalley. Now available.\n\nBlog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/\n\n---\n\nTitle: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: ***5 Stars***\n\nThis was one of those books where, when someone asks you what the book you are reading is about, you are kind of at a loss for words. Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.\n\nBut was it?\n\nNot gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).\n\nDespite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.\n\nWell, while I can't say that I'm not lazy or that my mind isn't mush despite never being a gamer, I can say that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, I really sucked at Mario Kart anyway.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nLike I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.\n\nBut again...was it really?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThis was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.\n\nIn today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent upon everything having to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.\n\nShowing not telling.\nAllowing me to absorb the message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.\nSo refreshing.\n\nAlso, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.\n\nOriginally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.\n\nP.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.\nP.P.S. You do need to love Marx.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: Complicated and Memorable\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.\n\nSam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.\n\nThe narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs. Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed. The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view). I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.\n\nSam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact. My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.\n\nThe novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.\n\nAll characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.\n\nI am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood. I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming. The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!). There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.\n\nThis is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.\n\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow [Gabrielle Zevin]\n\nDescription: I feel... really disappointed by this. I've loved Zevin's books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn't make this book any less tedious for me.\n\nThe story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children's ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.\n\nI will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.\n\nThat being said, I do not consider \"gamer\" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.\n\nKirkus assured me that even those who \"have never played a video game in their lives\" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn't true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.\n\nSome people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn't all that long. It feels much longer."
