I'm always a little hesitant when an author has been around for so long. What if they've lost their verve and zest for writing and are now just doing it to put out one more book? But gosh, I didn't need to worry at all.\n\nThe Hotel Nantucket was the consummate summer reading experience. It transported me to Nantucket, and I fell in love with the island, the atmosphere, and all the wonderful characters.\n\nInstead of focusing solely on one or two individuals, this story is more of an ensemble cast, with many characters taking up the pages. And while that took me a few chapters to get into, once I did, I was all in. I can honestly say there wasn't a single character I wasn't fond of, and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know everyone and seeing them grow through the pages.\n\nIf I had to nitpick something, it would be that there were two characters with almost the same name. There's Sweet Edie (a main character) and Fast Eddie (only a side one). Thankfully, Fast Eddie only appears a few times, though it did confuse me every time he did. But I really had to reach hard to come up with this minor quibble.\n\nNo doubt about it, I just about savored every moment of this book. I read it almost entirely outside, soaking up the sunshine and with various fruit-flavored bubble teas in hand. Summers are so special and inevitably too short. Especially this year, having lost half of my summer due to moving and feeling unwell, I'm doubly thankful to have found this gem of a story. It totally buoyed my spirits and added that extra spark to my otherwise abbreviated summer.\n\nNow my only remaining question is: could the ending have been a teensy-weensy wink towards a sequel? I sure hope so!\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Hotel Nantucket [Elin Hilderbrand]\n\nDescription: Is it summer? It must be because Elin's new Nantucket book is almost out.\n\nEvery year, I wait (in)patiently for her new story. I have enjoyed so many of her other books and she always amazes me with how she is able to transport me to Nantucket, a place I have never been (but I want to go).\n\nSo what did Elin have in mind for this novel? Well, I would say that she centers the storyline on the people working at the Hotel Nantucket. The hotel was an eyesore until British billionaire, Xavier Darling decides to buy it and renovate it in the most luxurious way. He hires Lizbet Keaton as his general manager. He tells her that he bought the hotel to impress two women. One of them is a mysterious blogger who rates hotels as Keys. No hotel has been able to get the 5 Keys. Darling wants the Hotel Nantucket to be the first. He doesn't tell Lizbet who the other woman is.\n\nLizbet decides to apply for the job after she discovered her boyfriend and chef of their restaurant sexting with another woman. No one on the island would have thought that they would break up after so many years. Liz knows she needs a change and demonstrating to the world that she can make the hotel a success becomes her next goal. She hires quite a few people and she is happy with her choices although she doesn't know the secrets they are keeping. Thankfully, the readers will get to discover all of them one by one including the person responsible for the death of a chambermaid killed in 1922 who has been haunting the hotel since her death.\n\nMy new favorite Elin Hilderbrand's audiobook!! Erin Bennet's masterful narration does a wonderful job of bringing these characters and Nantucket to life.\n\nI liked all the characters but I guess my favorites were Lizbet, Longshot, and the kids. I also loved how Elin incorporated some of her past characters from other books into this one. I always like to know how those characters are doing. In this case, Fast Eddie made a few appearances.\n\nIn addition to writing a fun and entertaining story, Elin gives us at the end of the book a list of places to visit in Nantucket. I know I will need it when I go. I just don't know if I want to go in the summer or for Christmas.\n\nCliffhanger: No\n\n5/5 Fangs\n\nA complimentary copy was provided by Hachette Audio, Little, Brown & Company via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Hotel Nantucket [Elin Hilderbrand]\n\nDescription: Hotel Nantucket\nLoved, loved this book. For what it is, a chocolate and popcorn book that most others call a hot summer read. An easy five stars for me.\nThe writing is smooth and almost luxurious and easy to drop into the fictive dream. This is because of the great writing craft. The author maintains several plot lines juggling them with skill and verve. But what is really impressive about this story is the micro-conflicts that come and go, branches to the main trunk.\nThe setup or conflict is rooted in a damaged love story, the main character’s heart is unjustly crushed by a long-time boyfriend. Add to this the start-up of a refurbished hotel that the new owner wants it to meet the highest standards on Nantucket island. There is a mystery hotel reviewer that holds sway and is pandered for a five-star review. A status not unlike a Michelin\nThrow into the mix a ghost. Yes, a ghost, but this apparition is only used as spice and to reveal past information that helps give the hotel equal weight as a main character. Which is difficult to do. The trials and tribulations are buried in the relationships that interact in and around the hotel. They swirl and ebb in such away the reader can’t look away and is tugged along in a most favorable way. The author flirts with maudlin and melodrama but never crosses that line.\nI highly recommend this novel. If you’re in need of a little ginger the same as in a sushi dinner to clear your literary palate this is the one for you.\nDavid Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series.\n\n---\n\nTitle: The Hotel Nantucket [Elin Hilderbrand]\n\nDescription: Welcome to the Summer of ‘69 ‘22! (minus any mentions of Covid so as not to pop the fantasy bubble) This summer on Nantucket Island centres on the first three months of the newly-renovated, re-opening of The Nantucket Hotel – a historical building more than one hundred years old that has had its fair share of past bad luck, tragedy, and poor business decisions, and is literally haunted by the ghost of a young woman. Now, under new ownership, and management, the new general manager, Lizbet Keaton, is determined to make the hotel the best it can be.\n\nAssisting Lizbet are the following core staff members:\n\nManning the front desk, ready to check you in and service your every need, are Alessandra Powell and Edith Robbins.\n\nBellmen Ezekiel ‘Zeke’ English, and Adam and Raoul Wasserman-Ramirez (married couple) will deliver your bags to your room within five minutes of your arrival.\n\nHead of Housekeeping, Magda English (Zeke’s aunt)and her young protégé Chadwick Winslow have a one hundred points cleaning checklist that they follow religiously.\n\nMario Subiaco is the chef of the Blue Bar – the hotel bar, and will serve you such sublime delicacies as deviled eggs with a trio of toppings, almond croissants, and a coconut and caramel apple whipped cream concoction.\n\nNight auditor, Richie Decameron is stationed at the front desk come nightfall.\n\nBut, as you would expect, these staff arrive with life baggage – secrets, trauma, dishonestly, and betrayal.\n\nWhen I’m in the mood for charming, relaxing, uplifting, light entertainment, with drama, romance and FOMO for a summer on Nantucket, I know I can rely on Elin Hilderbrand, and The Hotel Nantucket delivered on all counts. Sure the writing and plot was at times cheesy and over-the-top (I mean there’s a ghost POV for heavens sake) but it’s all in good positive fun, and this is a sub genre of books that includes serious and emotional topics, but at the same time shouldn’t be taken too seriously. After weeks of rain here in wintery New Zealand, it definitely cheered me up, and of course it is the perfect choice for your summer vacation, beach read, and airplane/airport. But, be advised, don’t read it if you’re hungry as the drool-worthy descriptions of delicious culinary may cause you to snack on the book.\n\nAs children, my two sisters and I, loved nothing more than exploring hotels we stayed in. I’m surprised we were never told off, although if we had of been we would’ve been genuinely apologetic, and my middle sister would’ve cried, so I’m sure all would’ve been forgiven. Anyway, my long-winded point is that that feeling of excitement, discovery, and imagination never leaves you, and I loved touring, exploring, and experiencing the various luxurious nooks and crannies of The Hotel Nantucket alongside the staff and guests, in particular seeing it through the eyes of eight-year-old Wanda – who was also a mystery fan, and inquisitive to boot.\n\nUnlike Elin Hilderbrand’s numerous ‘summer’ books set in Nantucket, this one doesn’t include any beach scenes, nor was The Hotel Nantucket a beachside hotel, so I’m a little confused by the cover, and would’ve preferred a photo of the hotel in question, since the majority of the action took place within its walls. But, never mind, it still screams summer.\n\nSo, make your Summer of ‘22 one to remember by adding The Hotel Nantucket to your tbr for the publication date of June 14th.\n\nI’d like to thank Netgalley US, Little Brown and Company, and Elin Hilderbrand for the e-ARC."
