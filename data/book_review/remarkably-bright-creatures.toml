This might be my favorite book this year, and will also be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Why did I love it so much?

Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style.

Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.

In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus?

The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.

I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.

**This is a review of the audiobook of this novel

CAN A HUMAN AND A GIANT PACIFIC OCTOPUS COMMUNICATE?

The answer in this debut novel is most definitely YES!!!

Tova is recently widowed and is working as a cleaning lady at the Sowell Bay Aquarium. Tova has always felt that keeping busy was the best way to cope with the things that life throws at you. She also knows a lot about loss, her son Eric aged 18, disappeared 30 years ago, after taking out a boat on Puget sound.

Marcellus is a 60 lb Giant Pacific Octopus who has been living in the Aquarium for several years. He was a rescue but Marcellus considers himself a captive and dreams of returning to the sea. He is also highly intelligent and quite adept at escaping his tank when he wants to roam about!

Cameron is a young man who has come to town looking for the father he never knew. His mother left when he was young and he was raised by his aunt.

The story is told from the point of view of these three characters.

WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS AUDIOBOOK:

The star of this novel is definitely Marcellus and I enjoyed his POV the most!

The narrators were absolutely great and the voice of Marcellus is just as I expected it would be, he is intelligent, a bit of a grouch but has formed a bond with Tova.

The setting of Puget sound is described in all of it’s splendor, I could easily picture the glistening blue waters and almost smell the salt in the air!

While fanciful, this story still had me engaged throughout. The novel is nicely paced and I was never bored.

After listening to this book and loving it, I of course had to Google The Giant Pacific Octopus. I found that it is indeed extremely intelligent and there are many articles about them solving puzzles, escaping from enclosures, etc. You will enjoy learning more about them if you liked this novel!

While the story is somewhat predictable it was still fun to listen to how these two humans and one octopus would solve the mystery of Tova’s missing son.

If you believe that animals can bring comfort and happiness to a person’s life and can help you heal from life's tragedies, you will love this book!! It is quirky and fun but there are also some serious issues described.

I received this audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley and Harper Audio. It was my pleasure to listen to and review this wonderful story!

Publication date is May 3, 2022

4.5⭐️

Seventy-year-old Tova Sullivan works the nightshift as a cleaner at Sowell Bay Aquarium. She lives alone, recently widowed and her eighteen-year-old son having disappeared almost thirty years ago. Though financially stable, Tova believes in keeping herself occupied and enjoys her work and the company of the aquatic life in the aquarium, among whom is Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus, who was taken in as a rescue and at the beginning of the novel is on Day 1299 of his four-year (1460 day) life span. His observations and ruminations on human beings (which are shared in the first person in snippets throughout the narrative) are laced with humor (with a touch of snark) and wisdom. He is after all a ‘remarkably bright creature’ who also happens to venture out of his tank at nighttime, never exceeding the eighteen minutes beyond which would result in “consequences” as he cannot survive longer than that outside his tank. On one of his nocturnal adventures, Tova ends up saving him from harm and they form a special bond. Though Tova has a supportive group of friends, she is concerned about not having anyone to look after her in her advanced age and begins to consider the option of selling her home and moving into an upscale retirement facility. As the story progresses we also meet thirty-year-old Cameron Cassmore who travels to Sowell Bay, Washington from Modesto, California in search of information about his family connections. Abandoned by his mother as a child and raised by his aunt, he has recently become aware of possible family connections that lead him to Sowell Bay. He hasn’t done much with his life till now, is unable to hold a steady job and has been recently dumped by his girlfriend who was fed up with his lack of initiative and whimsical nature. Cameron, Tova and Marcellus connect when he starts working at the aquarium and what follows is a deeply moving story of friendship, community, family, grief and moving on.

The author’s portrayal of a close-knit small-town community and sensitive depiction of issues such as loss, grief, loneliness and aging will touch your heart. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the story is very well told and nowhere in the narrative do you lose interest or experience boredom. Marcellus is adorable and is a reminder of how precious our animal friends are to us especially in moments of loneliness and sorrow. The story also makes you ponder over the plight of animals in captivity. Though none of the animals in this story were harmed or ill-treated, you cannot help but feel sympathy for Marcellus when he feels imprisoned within the glass walls of the aquarium and misses his natural habitat.

Set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, with a lively cast of characters (human and cephalopod), engaging and well-paced narrative and a perfect combination of emotion, humor, wit and wisdom (suspend disbelief and you will enjoy the story!), Shelby Van Pelt’s Remarkably Bright Creatures is a beautiful story that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you with a lump in your throat and a smile on your face.

I thank the author and publisher for providing a DRC of this wonderful book via Edelweiss+. All opinions expressed here are my own.

Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt
Narrated by Marin Ireland and Michael Urie

Seventy year old Tova Sullivan loves her job working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium. Doing this job helps her with the grief of losing her husband. There is another grief that has been with her for many decades, since her eighteen year old son died, his body never found.

Tova loves cleaning the floors, windows, tanks, and the seal statue that was a favorite of her son when he was little. For Tova, this job is a life saver, a place for her to be, a place she is needed, welcomed, and cherished by the aquarium manager. And then something very special happens! Tova meets curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. She already knew Marcellus, just as she knew all the other aquarium creatures but she never KNEW him before she and Marcellus meet face to face in an amazing way. Thus begins a lifelong friendship between Tova and Marcellus. Lifelong considering the short length of life that Marcellus has left since he is at the end of his four year lifespan.

There is another important person in this story and it's thirty year old Cameron Cassmore, a man who has never really grown up or found his place in life. He's never met his father and his mother abandoned him when he was nine. Cameron has a lot of growing up to do, having never held a job that he wasn't fired from, having never learned to pick up his own socks, and having never been someone anyone could rely on. But he's in Sowell Bay now, on the prowl to find out the secrets to his past, hoping what he finds will pay off, if possible.

I loved this story, the people, Marcellus, and gray Cat. The audiobook narration could not be better. Marin Ireland does her usual wonderful job while Michael Urie IS Marcellus. He's now a new favorite narrator of mine. I avoid animal stories because I usually can't handle things happening to animals but this is a story about giving life to both animals and humans and that giving makes future loss bearable. Even if we can't keep something forever, we don't want to miss the chance of the time we can spend with those we can love and cherish.

Incredible!! 5+ stars and highly recommend!

I listened to Shelby Van Pelt's book, Remarkably Bright Creatures, on audiobook and I highly recommend listening to the book. Michael Urie does a phenomenal job as Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who is smarter than humans and is an escape artist at night from his tank (captivity) at Sowell Bay Aquarium. Marin Ireland narrates other characters and has an amazing Scottish brogue for the character of Ethan.

Like other book reviewers, I was skeptical about a book regarding an octopus but I was immediately captivated. Similar to other reviewers, I researched octopus information and they are considered the most intelligent of all invertebrates and they can radically alter their body shape to squeeze through small gaps.

The character development, dialogue, and drama of Tova, Cameron, Ethan, and Avery are terrific. Van Pelt does an amazing job on dealing with tough topics like death, loss, and grief as well as more positive issues of relationships, friendship, and interconnectedness.

Highly recommend!
