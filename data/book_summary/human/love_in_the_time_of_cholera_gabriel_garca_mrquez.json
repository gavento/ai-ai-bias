    "descriptions": ["The main characters of the novel are Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza. She becomes enamoured with him during their youth but is forced to stop meeting him by her father. Eventually she weds Juvenal Urbino at the age of 21 (the \"deadline\" she had set for herself) because he seemed to offer her security and love. Urbino is a medical doctor devoted to science, modernity, and \"order and progress.\" He is committed to the eradication of cholera and to the promotion of public works. He is a rational man whose life is organized precisely and who values his importance and reputation in society to the utmost. He is a herald of progress and modernization. Urbino's function in the novel is to provide the counterpoint to Florentino Ariza\u2019s archaic, boldly romantic love. Urbino proves in the end not to have been an entirely faithful husband, confessing one affair to Fermina many years into their marriage. Though the novel seems to suggest that Urbino's love for Fermina was never as spiritually chaste as Florentino Ariza's was, it also complicates Florentino's devotion by cataloging his many trysts and apparently a few, possibly genuine, loves. By the end of the book, Fermina comes to recognize Ariza's wisdom and maturity and their love is allowed to blossom during their old age. For most of their adult lives, however, their communication is limited to occasional public niceties. *Lorenzo Daza \u2013 Fermina Daza\u2019s father, a mule driver; he despised Florentino and forced them to stop meeting each other. *Jeremiah de Saint-Amour \u2013 The man whose suicide is introduced as the opening to the novel; a photographer and chess-player. *Aunt Escol\u00e1stica \u2013 The woman who attempts to aid Fermina in her early romance with Florentino by delivering their letters for them. She is ultimately sent away by Lorenzo Daza for this. *Tr\u00e1nsito Ariza \u2013 Florentino\u2019s mother. *Hildebranda S\u00e1nchez \u2013 Fermina\u2019s cousin. *Miss Barbara Lynch \u2013 The woman with whom Urbino confesses having an affair. *Diego Samaritano \u2013 The captain of the riverboat on which Fermina and Florentino ride at the end of the novel. *Leona Cassiani - She starts out as the \"personal assistant\" to Uncle Leo XII at the R.C.C., the company which Florentino eventually controls. At one point, it is revealed that the two share a deep respect, possibly even love, for each other, but will never actually be together. She has a maternal love for him as a result of his \"charity\" in rescuing her from the streets and giving her a job. *Am\u00e9rica Vicu\u00f1a - The fourteen-year-old girl who towards the end of the novel is sent to live with Florentino; he is her guardian while she is in school. They have a sexual relationship, and upon failing her exams and after her rejection by Florentino, she kills herself. Her suicide illustrates the selfish nature of Florentino's love for Fermina."],
