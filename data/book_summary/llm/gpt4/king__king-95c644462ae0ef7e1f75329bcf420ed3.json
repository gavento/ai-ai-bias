His mother, a grouchy Queen who is tired of ruling and wishes to pass on the responsibility to her son, insists he must find a princess to marry. The prince tells his mom \"Very well, Mother.... I must say, though, I've never cared much for princesses.\" His mother marches princess after princess through the castle, from places ranging from Greenland to Mumbai, but in spite of their various talents &mdash; Princess Aria of Austria sings opera, Princess Dolly from Texas juggles and does magic tricks &mdash; they fail to interest the prince (though the prince's page falls in love with the princess from Greenland). After a while, along comes Princess Madeleine escorted by her brother Prince Lee. At the same time, both Bertie and Lee exclaim, \"What a wonderful prince!\" The princes immediately fall in love, and they begin marriage preparations at once. The wedding is attended by all the rejected princesses and their families; the two princes are declared King and King, and the Queen can finally relax, sunning herself in a lounge chair near the page and the princess from Greenland. The story ends with a kiss between the two kings. The illustrations are created as collages with cut paper and mixed-media art, including ink and paint."
