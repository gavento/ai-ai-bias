Miles visits the Barrayaran Embassy so the Dendarii can be paid for their last mission. There he finds his cousin Ivan Vorpatril working for the distinctly hostile Captain Duv Galeni, who turns out to be a Komarran related to one of the alleged victims of Miles' father. Miles is reassigned to the Embassy as Third Military Attach√©, under Galeni's command. Further complicating matters, Miles discovers he has a clone, created and trained as an assassin by Komarran diehards determined to free their planet. The assassination plot is foiled. Miles allows his clone to escape; by Betan law, the clone is his brother, and Miles is well aware his formidable mother would be greatly displeased if he got rid of his troublesome new sibling. According to Barrayaran tradition, his brother would be named Mark Pierre Vorkosigan. In exchange for \"Mark\" helping Miles fool the Cetagandans, who are beginning to suspect that Naismith and Vorkosigan are the same person, the psychologically scarred Mark is let go with a considerable sum of money and the invitation to claim his Barrayaran heritage, if he wants to&mdash;or dares."
