        "\"Asterix and the Great Crossing\" is a humorous tale of Asterix and Obelix's unexpected adventure to North America while on a mission to find fresh fish for Getafix's potion. After getting lost at sea, they encounter Native Americans whom they mistake for Romans due to their facial paintings. After leaving the island to avoid an unwanted engagement for Obelix, they are found by Vikings who take them to their homeland as proof of land beyond Europe. The Gauls take advantage of a fight between the Vikings to make their escape, aided by a Gaulish prisoner who can procure the fresh fish they need for their potion. The twist is that Unhygenix, the original requester of the fish, actually prefers the smell of his own, less fresh stock.",
        "In \"Asterix and the Great Crossing,\" Asterix and Obelix go on a fishing trip to gather fresh fish for Getafix's magic potion. They get lost and end up in North America, where they befriend the native \"Romans\" and encounter the delicious \"gobbler\" bird. When the local centurion tries to marry his daughter off to Obelix, the duo leave and encounter a group of Vikings on another island. The Vikings, eager to prove there are continents beyond Europe, take Asterix and Obelix back to their homeland. There, they learn of a plot to sacrifice them and must escape with the help of Catastrofix, a Gaulish prisoner who can understand both Gallic and Norse. They manage to get away and procure the fish they initially set out to get, completing their original mission.\n",
        "In \"Asterix and the Great Crossing,\" Asterix and Obelix are sent on a mission to fetch fresh fish for a potion. They end up lost at sea and land on what appears to be North America, where they encounter \"Romans\" with facial paintings (Indians) and gobblers (turkeys). After refusing an arranged marriage to a chief's daughter, they are picked up by a group of anachronistic Vikings. The Vikings hope to prove the existence of continents beyond Europe by bringing Asterix and Obelix back to their homeland. When the Gauls are almost sacrificed at a celebration, another Gaulish prisoner named Catastrofix stirs up suspicion about the Vikings' story, causing a fight and allowing the Gauls to escape. The escape proves fortuitous, as Catastrofix is a fisherman and can provide the needed fish for the potion. The fish, however, are not to the liking of Unhygenix, who prefers his own stock.",

Use the sample as a guideline for quality and level of detail.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Asterix and the Great Crossing\n\nDescription: Unhygienix is out of fresh fish (as always), which is carted overland in ox-drawn carts from Lutetia (Paris), and causing it to get unhealthy on the long trip, and Getafix says that he needs some for his potion. Asterix and Obelix borrow a boat from Geriatrix and go fishing. After a storm, they get lost, but despite Obelix's concerns, they do not reach the edge of the world; instead- following a brief encounter with the pirates-, they arrive on an island (which is actually North America) with delicious birds that the Gauls call \"gobblers\" (turkeys), bears and \"Romans\" with strange facial paintings (Indians). Soon they earn the \"Romans\"' affection, but they decide to leave after the \"centurion\" chooses Obelix as his rather rubenesque daughter's fiancé. They go to a small island. Seeing a boat coming, Asterix climbs a cairn of rocks holding a torch and a book like the Statue of Liberty to attract it. The crew are anachronistic Vikings (with names like Herendethelessen, Steptøånssen, Nøgøødreåssen, Håråldwilssen, Irmgard, Firegård, and their Great Dane, Huntingseåssen) - who managed a Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact and take the Gauls, who they thought to be the local natives, to their homeland as proof that there are continents beyond Europe. Their mutual desperation, the Gauls wanting to return home, and the Vikings' eagerness to prove their story of a new world, results in a trip back to Europe to the Vikings' homeland. The Vikings' chief, Ødiuscomparissen, greets them and is skeptical of their stories, until he sees the Gauls. They plan a celebration, then attempt to sacrifice the \"natives\", much to the chagrin of the other Vikings (\"Why? They haven't done anything!\"). Before this can be carried out, a Gaulish prisoner called Catastrofix, who can understand both Gallic and Norse, stirs up Ødiuscomparissen's suspicion that Herendethelessen is a liar, causing a fight between the Vikings with the assumption that Herendethelessen has simply gone to Gaul rather than to a new world. Meanwhile, the Gauls escape. This escape is conducive to their original purpose, since Catastrofix is a fisherman and hence able to procure some fish for the magic potion. Unhygenix, however, prefers the scent of his own stock; a preference that explains why his product is such a delicate and filthy topic."
