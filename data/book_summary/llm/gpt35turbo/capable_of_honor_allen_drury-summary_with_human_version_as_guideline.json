        "Title: Capable of Honor [Allen Drury]\n\nSummary: \"Capable of Honor\" is a political novel that follows the story of Harley Hudson, the Vice President from the previous book \"Advise and Consent,\" as he becomes the President and seeks re-election. The backdrop of the story is a Soviet-instigated war, where the Soviet Union supports rebel governments in Panama and the fictional African republic of Gorotoland. Hudson responds by sending U.S. troops to both countries, but the conflicts become prolonged and difficult. As the election season approaches, the focus shifts to foreign policy, with the media and others searching for a peace candidate. They find their candidate in Governor Ted Jason of California, who is popular but lacks strong will. Hudson, who had announced his candidacy late, opens up the Vice Presidential nomination to a contest between Secretary of State Orrin Knox, who supports his policies, and Jason. The media, previously supportive of Jason, continues to push for his victory by any means necessary. The party convention in San Francisco becomes chaotic, with extreme elements from both the Left and Right supporting Jason. Violent incidents occur, including an attack on Knox's daughter-in-law. When it becomes evident that the convention is divided over the party platform, Jason challenges Hudson for the Majority Party's nomination. The media manipulates the situation to control the narrative, while Ceil Jason, the Governor's wife, leaves him due to his lack of principles and tolerance for violence. In the end, Hudson narrowly wins the nomination and humiliates Jason by making it clear that he only considers Knox as his running mate. The convention nominates Knox, but a significant number of delegates walk out in protest, leading to speculation about a third-party convention.",

Use the sample as a guideline for quality and level of detail.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Capable of Honor [Allen Drury]\n\nDescription: In the novel, Harley Hudson, the affable but inept Vice President from Advise and Consent, is now president and seeking a term of his own against a backdrop of Soviet-instigated war, as the Soviet Union backs rebel governments in Panama and in the fictitious African republic of Gorotoland. Hudson responds with U.S. troops in both countries, and the conflicts soon bog down. The election season soon turns on these foreign policy questions, with the media and others seeking a peace candidate &mdash; and finding it in the popular but weak-willed Governor Ted Jason of California. Having announced his candidacy late, Hudson announces an open contest for the Vice Presidential nomination, in which Secretary of State Orrin Knox, who supports Hudson's policies, opposes Jason. The media, who had supported Jason heavily when it looked like it would be a Knox-Jason race for the Presidential nomination, continues its effort for a Jason victory by any means they can. At the convention in San Francisco, extreme elements of the Left and Right combine to support Jason, and there are several violent incidents, including one in which Knox's daughter-in-law is brutally attacked. When it becomes clear that the convention is split down the middle in fights over the platform, Jason challenges Hudson for the Majority Party's nomination (the novels never use the proper names \"Republican\" or \"Democrat\" but the descriptions of Majority Party corresponds strongly to the Democrats of the 1960s). The media, meantime, spins merrily away, filtering what the country is allowed to see and hear from San Francisco. Ceil Jason, the Governor's wife, leaves him when her husband's lack of principle and willingness to tolerate the violence sinks in to her. Hudson wins narrowly, and Jason expects the Vice Presidential nomination since he commands the support of almost half the convention. Hudson seems amenable, and places Jason on the dais as he makes his acceptance speech. Hudson humiliates Jason by making it clear that he considers Jason a panderer, and states he will accept Knox, and only Knox, as his running mate. The convention duly nominates Knox, but almost half its delegates walk out, to the pleasure of the media commentators, who predict a third-party convention from among the disaffected delegates."
