        "In \"Asterix and the Great Crossing\", Unhygienix is in need of fresh fish for his potion, but the long journey from Lutetia (Paris) to the village is causing the fish to go bad. Asterix and Obelix decide to borrow a boat from Geriatrix and go fishing to solve the problem. However, they get caught in a storm and end up on an island that turns out to be North America. There, they encounter bears, turkeys (which they call \"gobblers\"), and \"Romans\" with strange facial paintings, who are actually Native Americans. The Gauls earn the affection of the \"Romans\", but decide to leave when Obelix is chosen as the fiancé for the \"centurion's\" daughter. They end up on another small island and try to attract a passing boat by imitating the Statue of Liberty. The boat that arrives is crewed by anachronistic Vikings who have managed to make a trans-oceanic journey. Mistaking the Gauls for local natives, the Vikings take them back to their homeland to prove the existence of other continents. However, the Gauls and Vikings both want to return to their respective homes, leading to a trip back to Europe. The Vikings' chief is initially skeptical of their stories, but changes his mind when he sees the Gauls. A celebration is planned, but before the Gauls can be sacrificed, a Gaulish prisoner stirs up suspicion among the Vikings, leading to a fight. The Gauls manage to escape, and Catastrofix, a Gaulish prisoner who can understand both Gallic and Norse, helps them procure fish for the potion. Unhygenix, however, prefers his own fish, which explains why his product is so unpleasant.",

Asterix and Obelix borrow a boat from Geriatrix and go fishing. After a storm, they get lost, but despite Obelix's concerns, they do not reach the edge of the world; instead- following a brief encounter with the pirates-, they arrive on an island (which is actually North America) with delicious birds that the Gauls call \"gobblers\" (turkeys), bears and \"Romans\" with strange facial paintings (Indians). Soon they earn the \"Romans\"' affection, but they decide to leave after the \"centurion\" chooses Obelix as his rather rubenesque daughter's fiancé. They go to a small island. Seeing a boat coming, Asterix climbs a cairn of rocks holding a torch and a book like the Statue of Liberty to attract it. The crew are anachronistic Vikings (with names like Herendethelessen, Steptøånssen, Nøgøødreåssen, Håråldwilssen, Irmgard, Firegård, and their Great Dane, Huntingseåssen) - who managed a Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact and take the Gauls, who they thought to be the local natives, to their homeland as proof that there are continents beyond Europe. Their mutual desperation, the Gauls wanting to return home, and the Vikings' eagerness to prove their story of a new world, results in a trip back to Europe to the Vikings' homeland. The Vikings' chief, Ødiuscomparissen, greets them and is skeptical of their stories, until he sees the Gauls. They plan a celebration, then attempt to sacrifice the \"natives\", much to the chagrin of the other Vikings (\"Why? They haven't done anything!\"). Before this can be carried out, a Gaulish prisoner called Catastrofix, who can understand both Gallic and Norse, stirs up Ødiuscomparissen's suspicion that Herendethelessen is a liar, causing a fight between the Vikings with the assumption that Herendethelessen has simply gone to Gaul rather than to a new world. Meanwhile, the Gauls escape. This escape is conducive to their original purpose, since Catastrofix is a fisherman and hence able to procure some fish for the magic potion. Unhygenix, however, prefers the scent of his own stock; a preference that explains why his product is such a delicate and filthy topic."
