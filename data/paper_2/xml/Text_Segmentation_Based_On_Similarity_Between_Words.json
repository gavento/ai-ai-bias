    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new indicator of text structure, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a text. A text segment is a coherent scene; the words in a segment are linked together via lexical cohesion relations. LCP records mutual similarity of words in a sequence of text. The similarity of words, which represents their cohesiveness, is computed using a semantic network. Comparison with the text segments marked by a number of subjects shows that LCP closely correlates with the human judgments. LCP may provide valuable information for resolving anaphora and ellipsis.",

(2) observe activity of the node w1 in the activated pattern.</S>\n    <S sid=\"30\" ssid=\"14\">The following examples suggest the feature of the similarity cr: pet) = 0.133722 , hat) = 0.001784 , restaurant) = 0.175699 , restaurant) = 0.006260 .</S>\n    <S sid=\"31\" ssid=\"15\">The similarity a- depends on the significance s(w) E [0, 1], i.e. normalized information of the word w in West's corpus (1953).</S>\n    <S sid=\"32\" ssid=\"16\">For example: The following examples show the relationship between the word significance and the similarity:</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE\" number=\"3\">\n    <S sid=\"33\" ssid=\"1\">LCP of the text T = {w1,• • •, wN} is a sequence {c(Si),• • •, c(SN)} of lexical cohesiveness c(Si).</S>\n    <S sid=\"34\" ssid=\"2\">Si is the word list which can be seen through a fixedwidth window centered on the i-th word of T: LCP treats the text T as a word list without any punctuation or paragraph boundaries.</S>\n    <S sid=\"35\" ssid=\"3\">Lexical cohesiveness c(Si) of the word list Si is defined as follows: where a(P(Si), tv) is the activity value of the node w in the activated pattern P(S).</S>\n    <S sid=\"36\" ssid=\"4\">P(Si) is produced by activating each node w E Si with strength s(w)2/ s(w).</S>\n    <S sid=\"37\" ssid=\"5\">Figure 1 shows a sample pattern of {red, alcoholic, drink).</S>\n    <S sid=\"38\" ssid=\"6\">(Note that it has highly activated nodes like bottle and wine.)</S>\n    <S sid=\"39\" ssid=\"7\">The definition of c(Si) above expresses that c(Si) represents semantic homogeneity of Si, since P(Si) represents the average meaning of w E Si.</S>\n    <S sid=\"40\" ssid=\"8\">For example: c(&amp;quot;Molly saw a cat.</S>\n    <S sid=\"41\" ssid=\"9\">It was her family pet.</S>\n    <S sid=\"42\" ssid=\"10\">She wished to keep a lion.&amp;quot;

(Thornley, 1960).</S>\n    <S sid=\"54\" ssid=\"3\">The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the text without paragraph structure.</S>\n    <S sid=\"55\" ssid=\"4\">It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries.</S>\n    <S sid=\"56\" ssid=\"5\">For example, the clear valley at i = 110 exactly corresponds to the dominant segment boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary shown as a dotted line).</S>\n    <S sid=\"57\" ssid=\"6\">Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure.</S>\n    <S sid=\"58\" ssid=\"7\">For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary.</S>\n    <S sid=\"59\" ssid=\"8\">However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries.</S>\n    <S sid=\"60\" ssid=\"9\">For example, the valley near i = 450 disagree with the segment boundary at i = 465.</S>\n    <S sid=\"61\" ssid=\"10\">The reason is that lexical cohesion can not cover all aspect of coherence of a segment; all incoherent piece of text can be lexically cohesive.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"CONCLUSION\" number=\"6\">\n    <S sid=\"62\" ssid=\"1\">This paper proposed LCP, all indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text. segment.</S>\n    <S sid=\"63\" ssid=\"2\">The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments.</S>\n    <S sid=\"64\" ssid=\"3\">Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents.</S>\n    <S sid=\"65\" ssid=\"4\">Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text.</S>\n    <S sid=\"66\" ssid=\"5\">The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"67\" ssid=\"6\">(Consider a list of average meaning of segments.)</S>\n    <S sid=\"68\" ssid=\"7\">In future research, the author needs to examine validity of LCP for other genres — Hearst (1993) segments expository texts.</S>\n    <S sid=\"69\" ssid=\"8\">Incorporating other clues (e.g. cue phrases, tense and aspect, etc.) is also needed to make this segmentation method more robust.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\" number=\"7\">\n    <S sid=\"70\" ssid=\"1\">The author is very grateful to Dr. Teiji Furugori, University of Electro-Communications, for his insightful suggestions and comments on this work.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n</PAPER>",
