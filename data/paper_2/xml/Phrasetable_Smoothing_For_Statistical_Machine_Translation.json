To make search more efficient, we use the Viterbi approximation and seek the most likely combination of t and its alignment a with s, rather than just the most likely t: where a = (˜s1, ˜t1, j1), ..., (˜sK, ˜tK, jK); ˜tk are target phrases such that t = ˜t1 ... ˜tK; ˜sk are source phrases such that s = ˜sj1 ... ˜sjK; and ˜sk is the translation of the kth target phrase ˜tk. where each fi(s, t, a) is a feature function, and weights Ai are set using Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003) to maximize the system’s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001) on a development corpus.</S>\n    <S sid=\"24\" ssid=\"2\">The features used in this study are: the length of t; a single-parameter distortion penalty on phrase reordering in a, as described in (Koehn et al., 2003); phrase translation model probabilities; and trigram language model probabilities log p(t), using Kneser-Ney smoothing as implemented in the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).</S>\n    <S sid=\"25\" ssid=\"3\">Phrase translation model probabilities are features of the form: ie, we assume that the phrases ˜sk specified by a are conditionally independent, and depend only on their aligned phrases ˜tk.</S>\n    <S sid=\"26\" ssid=\"4\">The “forward” phrase probabilities p(˜t|˜s) are not used as features, but only as a filter on the set of possible translations: for each source phrase s˜ that matches some ngram in s, only the 30 top-ranked translations t˜ according to p(˜t|˜s) are retained.</S>\n    <S sid=\"27\" ssid=\"5\">To derive the joint counts c(˜s, ˜t) from which p(˜s|˜t) and p(˜t|˜s) are estimated, we use the phrase induction algorithm described in (Koehn et al., 2003), with symmetrized word alignments generated using IBM model 2 (Brown et al., 1993).</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"3 Smoothing Techniques\" number=\"3\">\n    <S sid=\"28\" ssid=\"1\">Smoothing involves some recipe for modifying conditional distributions away from pure relativefrequency estimates made from joint counts, in order to compensate for data sparsity.</S>\n    <S sid=\"29\" ssid=\"2\">In the spirit of ((Hastie et al., 2001), figure 2.11, pg.</S>\n    <S sid=\"30\" ssid=\"3\">38) smoothing can be seen as a way of combining the relativefrequency estimate, which is a model with high complexity, high variance, and low bias, with another model with lower complexity, lower variance, and high bias, in the hope of obtaining better performance on new data.</S>\n    <S sid=\"31\" ssid=\"4\">There are two main ingredients in all such recipes: some probability distribution that is smoother than relative frequencies (ie, that has fewer parameters and is thus less complex) and some technique for combining that distribution with relative frequency estimates.</S>\n    <S sid=\"32\" ssid=\"5\">We will now discuss both these choices: the distribution for carrying out smoothing and the combination technique.</S>\n    <S sid=\"33\" ssid=\"6\">In this discussion, we use ˜p() to denote relative frequency distributions.</S>\n    <S sid=\"34\" ssid=\"7\">One can distinguish between two approaches to smoothing phrase tables.</S>\n    <S sid=\"35\" ssid=\"8\">Black-box techniques do not look inside phrases but instead treat them as atomic objects: that is, both the s˜ and the t˜ in the expression p(˜s|˜t) are treated as units about which nothing is known except their counts.</S>\n    <S sid=\"36\" ssid=\"9\">In contrast, glass-box methods break phrases down into their component words.</S>\n    <S sid=\"37\" ssid=\"10\">The black-box approach, which is the simpler of the two, has received little attention in the SMT literature.</S>\n    <S sid=\"38\" ssid=\"11\">An interesting aspect of this approach is that it allows one to implement phrasetable smoothing techniques that are analogous to LM smoothing techniques, by treating the problem of estimating p(˜s|˜t) as if it were the problem of estimating a bigram conditional probability.</S>\n    <S sid=\"39\" ssid=\"12\">In this paper, we give experimental results for phrasetable smoothing techniques analogous to Good-Turing, Fixed-Discount, Kneser-Ney, and Modified Kneser-Ney LM smoothing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"40\" ssid=\"13\">Glass-box methods for phrasetable smoothing have been described by other authors: see section 3.3.</S>\n    <S sid=\"41\" ssid=\"14\">These authors decompose p(˜s|˜t) into a set of lexical distributions p(s|˜t) by making independence assumptions about the words s in ˜s.</S>\n    <S sid=\"42\" ssid=\"15\">The other possibility, which is similar in spirit to ngram LM lower-order estimates, is to combine estimates made by replacing words in t˜ with wildcards, as proposed in section 3.4.</S>\n    <S sid=\"43\" ssid=\"16\">Although we explored a variety of black-box and glass-box smoothing distributions, we only tried two combination techniques: linear interpolation, which we used for black-box smoothing, and loglinear interpolation, which we used for glass-box smoothing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"44\" ssid=\"17\">For black-box smoothing, we could have used a backoff scheme or an interpolation scheme.</S>\n    <S sid=\"45\" ssid=\"18\">Backoff schemes have the form: pb(˜s |˜t) is a smooth backoff distribution, and τ is a threshold above which counts are considered reliable.</S>\n    <S sid=\"46\" ssid=\"19\">Typically, τ = 1 and ph(˜s |˜t) is version of ˜p(˜s|˜t) modified to reserve some probability mass for unseen events.</S>\n    <S sid=\"47\" ssid=\"20\">Interpolation schemes have the general form: where α and β are combining coefficients.</S>\n    <S sid=\"48\" ssid=\"21\">As noted in (Chen and Goodman, 1998), a key difference between interpolation and backoff is that the former approach uses information from the smoothing distribution to modify ˜p(˜s|˜t) for higher-frequency events, whereas the latter uses it only for low-frequency events (most often 0frequency events).</S>\n    <S sid=\"49\" ssid=\"22\">Since for phrasetable smoothing, better prediction of unseen (zero-count) events has no direct impact—only seen events are represented in the phrasetable, and thus hypothesized during decoding—interpolation seemed a more suitable approach.</S>\n    <S sid=\"50\" ssid=\"23\">For combining relative-frequency estimates with glass-box smoothing distributions, we employed loglinear interpolation.</S>\n    <S sid=\"51\" ssid=\"24\">This is the traditional approach for glass-box smoothing (Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004).</S>\n    <S sid=\"52\" ssid=\"25\">To illustrate the difference between linear and loglinear interpolation, consider combining two Bernoulli distributions p1(x) and p2(x) using each method: where qi(x) = 1 − pi(x).</S>\n    <S sid=\"53\" ssid=\"26\">Setting p2(x) = 0.5 to simulate uniform smoothing gives ploglin(x) = p1(x)α/(p1(x)α + q1(x)α).</S>\n    <S sid=\"54\" ssid=\"27\">This is actually less smooth than the original distribution p1(x): it preserves extreme values 0 and 1, and makes intermediate values more extreme.</S>\n    <S sid=\"55\" ssid=\"28\">On the other hand, plinear(x) = αp1(x) + (1 − α)/2, which has the opposite properties: it moderates extreme values and tends to preserve intermediate values.</S>\n    <S sid=\"56\" ssid=\"29\">An advantage of loglinear interpolation is that we can tune loglinear weights so as to maximize the true objective function, for instance BLEU; recall that our translation model is itself loglinear, with weights set to minimize errors.</S>\n    <S sid=\"57\" ssid=\"30\">In fact, a limitation of the experiments described in this paper is that the loglinear weights for the glass-box techniques were optimized for BLEU using Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003), while the linear weights for black-box techniques were set heuristically.</S>\n    <S sid=\"58\" ssid=\"31\">Obviously, this gives the glass-box techniques an advantage when the different smoothing techniques are compared using BLEU!</S>\n    <S sid=\"59\" ssid=\"32\">Implementing an algorithm for optimizing linear weights according to BLEU is high on our list of priorities.</S>\n    <S sid=\"60\" ssid=\"33\">The preceding discussion implicitly assumes a single set of counts c(˜s, ˜t) from which conditional distributions are derived.</S>\n    <S sid=\"61\" ssid=\"34\">But, as phrases of different lengths are likely to have different statistical properties, it might be worthwhile to break down the global phrasetable into separate phrasetables for each value of |˜t |for the purposes of smoothing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"62\" ssid=\"35\">Any similar strategy that does not split up 1˜s|c(˜s, ˜t) &gt; 01 for any fixed t˜ can be applied to any smoothing scheme.</S>\n    <S sid=\"63\" ssid=\"36\">This is another idea we are eager to try soon.</S>\n    <S sid=\"64\" ssid=\"37\">We now describe the individual smoothing schemes we have implemented.</S>\n    <S sid=\"65\" ssid=\"38\">Four of them are black-box techniques: Good-Turing and three fixed-discount techniques (fixed-discount interpolated with unigram distribution, Kneser-Ney fixed-discount, and modified Kneser-Ney fixeddiscount).</S>\n    <S sid=\"66\" ssid=\"39\">Two of them are glass-box techniques: Zens-Ney “noisy-or” and Koehn-Och-Marcu IBM smoothing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"67\" ssid=\"40\">Our experiments tested not only these individual schemes, but also some loglinear combinations of a black-box technique with a glassbox technique.</S>\n    <S sid=\"68\" ssid=\"41\">Good-Turing smoothing is a well-known technique (Church and Gale, 1991) in which observed counts c are modified according to the formula: and Gale, 1991).</S>\n    <S sid=\"69\" ssid=\"42\">We first take the log of the observed (c, nc) values, and then use a linear least squares fit to log nc as a function of log c. To ensure that the result stays close to the reliable values of nc for large c, error terms are weighted by c, ie: c(log nc − log n')2, where n' are the fitted values.</S>\n    <S sid=\"70\" ssid=\"43\">Our implementation pools all counts c(˜s, ˜t) together to obtain n' (we have not yet tried separate counts based on length of t˜ as discussed above).</S>\n    <S sid=\"71\" ssid=\"44\">It follows directly from (2) that the total count mass assigned to unseen phrase pairs is cg(0)n0 = n1, which we approximate by ni.</S>\n    <S sid=\"72\" ssid=\"45\">This mass is distributed among contexts t˜ in proportion to c(˜t), giving final estimates: where p(˜t) = c(˜t)/ Et� c(˜t).</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"3.2 Fixed-Discount Methods\" number=\"4\">\n    <S sid=\"73\" ssid=\"1\">Fixed-discount methods subtract a fixed discount D from all non-zero counts, and distribute the resulting probability mass according to a smoothing distribution (Kneser and Ney, 1995).</S>\n    <S sid=\"74\" ssid=\"2\">We use an interpolated version of fixed-discount proposed by (Chen and Goodman, 1998) rather than the original backoff version.</S>\n    <S sid=\"75\" ssid=\"3\">For phrase pairs with nonzero counts, this distribution has the general form: where pb(˜s|˜t) is the smoothing distribution.</S>\n    <S sid=\"76\" ssid=\"4\">Normalization constraints fix the value of α(˜t): where cg is a modified count value used to replace c in subsequent relative-frequency estimates, and nc is the number of events having count c. An intuitive motivation for this formula is that it approximates relative-frequency estimates made by successively leaving out each event in the corpus, and then averaging the results (N´adas, 1985).</S>\n    <S sid=\"77\" ssid=\"5\">A practical difficulty in implementing GoodTuring smoothing is that the nc are noisy for large c. For instance, there may be only one phrase pair that occurs exactly c = 347,623 times in a large corpus, and no pair that occurs c = 347,624 times, leading to cg(347, 623) = 0, clearly not what is intended.</S>\n    <S sid=\"78\" ssid=\"6\">Our solution to this problem is based on the technique described in (Church s� where n1+(*, ˜t) is the number of phrases s˜ for which c(˜s, ˜t) &gt; 0.</S>\n    <S sid=\"79\" ssid=\"7\">We experimented with two choices for the smoothing distribution pb(˜s|˜t).</S>\n    <S sid=\"80\" ssid=\"8\">The first is a plain unigram p(˜s), and the second is the Kneser-Ney lower-order distribution: ie, the proportion of unique target phrases that s˜ is associated with, where n1+(˜s, *) is defined analogously to n1+(*, ˜t).</S>\n    <S sid=\"81\" ssid=\"9\">Intuitively, the idea is that source phrases that co-occur with many different target phrases are more likely to appear in new contexts.</S>\n    <S sid=\"82\" ssid=\"10\">For both unigram and Kneser-Ney smoothing distributions, we used a discounting coefficient derived by (Ney et al., 1994) on the basis of a leaveone-out analysis: D = n1/(n1 + 2n2).</S>\n    <S sid=\"83\" ssid=\"11\">For the Kneser-Ney smoothing distribution, we also tested the “Modified Kneser-Ney” extension suggested in (Chen and Goodman, 1998), in which specific coefficients Dc are used for small count values c up to a maximum of three (ie D3 is used for c ≥ 3).</S>\n    <S sid=\"84\" ssid=\"12\">For c = 2 and c = 3, we used formulas given in that paper.</S>\n    <S sid=\"85\" ssid=\"13\">The two glass-box techniques that we considered involve decomposing source phrases with independence assumptions.</S>\n    <S sid=\"86\" ssid=\"14\">The simplest approach assumes that all source words are conditionally independent, so that: We implemented two variants for p(sj|˜t) that are described in previous work.</S>\n    <S sid=\"87\" ssid=\"15\">(Zens and Ney, 2004) describe a “noisy-or” combination: where ¯sj is the probability that sj is not in the translation of ˜t, and p(sj|ti) is a lexical probability.</S>\n    <S sid=\"88\" ssid=\"16\">(Zens and Ney, 2004) obtain p(sj|ti) from smoothed relative-frequency estimates in a wordaligned corpus.</S>\n    <S sid=\"89\" ssid=\"17\">Our implementation simply uses IBM1 probabilities, which obviate further smoothing.</S>\n    <S sid=\"90\" ssid=\"18\">The noisy-or combination stipulates that sj should not appear in s˜ if it is not the translation of any of the words in ˜t.</S>\n    <S sid=\"91\" ssid=\"19\">The complement of this, proposed in (Koehn et al., 2005), to say that sj should appear in s˜ if it is the translation of at least one of the words in ˜t: where Aj is a set of likely alignment connections for sj.</S>\n    <S sid=\"92\" ssid=\"20\">In our implementation of this method, we assumed that Aj = {1, ... , ˜I}, ie the set of all connections, and used IBM1 probabilities for p(s|t).</S>\n    <S sid=\"93\" ssid=\"21\">We mentioned earlier that LM ngrams have a naturally-ordered sequence of smoothing distributions, obtained by successively dropping the last word in the context.</S>\n    <S sid=\"94\" ssid=\"22\">For phrasetable smoothing, because no word in t˜ is a priori less informative than any others, there is no exact parallel to this technique.</S>\n    <S sid=\"95\" ssid=\"23\">However, it is clear that estimates made by replacing particular target (conditioning) words with wildcards will be smoother than the original relative frequencies.</S>\n    <S sid=\"96\" ssid=\"24\">A simple scheme for combining them is just to average: One might also consider progressively replacing the least informative remaining word in the target phrase (using tf-idf or a similar measure).</S>\n    <S sid=\"97\" ssid=\"25\">The same idea could be applied in reverse, by replacing particular source (conditioned) words with wildcards.</S>\n    <S sid=\"98\" ssid=\"26\">We have not yet implemented this new glass-box smoothing technique, but it has considerable appeal.</S>\n    <S sid=\"99\" ssid=\"27\">The idea is similar in spirit to Collins’ backoff method for prepositional phrase attachment (Collins and Brooks, 1995).</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"4 Related Work\" number=\"5\">\n    <S sid=\"100\" ssid=\"1\">As mentioned previously, (Chen and Goodman, 1998) give a comprehensive survey and evaluation of smoothing techniques for language modeling.</S>\n    <S sid=\"101\" ssid=\"2\">As also mentioned previously, there is relatively little published work on smoothing for statistical MT.</S>\n    <S sid=\"102\" ssid=\"3\">For the IBM models, alignment probabilities need to be smoothed for combinations of sentence lengths and positions not encountered in training data (Garcia-Varea et al., 1998).</S>\n    <S sid=\"103\" ssid=\"4\">Moore (2004) has found that smoothing to correct overestimated IBM1 lexical probabilities for rare words can improve word-alignment performance.</S>\n    <S sid=\"104\" ssid=\"5\">Langlais (2005) reports negative results for synonym-based smoothing of IBM2 lexical probabilities prior to extracting phrases for phrasebased SMT.</S>\n    <S sid=\"105\" ssid=\"6\">For phrase-based SMT, the use of smoothing to avoid zero probabilities during phrase induction is reported in (Marcu and Wong, 2002), but no details are given.</S>\n    <S sid=\"106\" ssid=\"7\">As described above, (Zens and Ney, 2004) and (Koehn et al., 2005) use two different variants of glass-box smoothing (which they call “lexical smoothing”) over the phrasetable, and combine the resulting estimates with pure relativefrequency ones in a loglinear model.</S>\n    <S sid=\"107\" ssid=\"8\">Finally, (Cettollo et al., 2005) describes the use of Witten-Bell smoothing (a black-box technique) for phrasetable counts, but does not give a comparison to other methods.</S>\n    <S sid=\"108\" ssid=\"9\">As Witten-Bell is reported by (Chen and Goodman, 1998) to be significantly worse than Kneser-Ney smoothing, we have not yet tested this method.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"5 Experiments\" number=\"6\">\n    <S sid=\"109\" ssid=\"1\">We carried out experiments in two different settings: broad-coverage ones across six European language pairs using selected smoothing techniques and relatively small training corpora; and Chinese to English experiments using all implemented smoothing techniques and large training corpora.</S>\n    <S sid=\"110\" ssid=\"2\">For the black-box techniques, the smoothed phrase table replaced the original relative-frequency (RF) phrase table.</S>\n    <S sid=\"111\" ssid=\"3\">For the glass-box techniques, a phrase table (either the original RF phrase table or its replacement after black-box smoothing) was interpolated in loglinear fashion with the smoothing glass-box distribution, with weights set to maximize BLEU on a development corpus.</S>\n    <S sid=\"112\" ssid=\"4\">To estimate the significance of the results across different methods, we used 1000-fold pairwise bootstrap resampling at the 95% confidence level.</S>\n    <S sid=\"113\" ssid=\"5\">In order to measure the benefit of phrasetable smoothing for relatively small corpora, we used the data made available for the WMT06 shared task (WMT, 2006).</S>\n    <S sid=\"114\" ssid=\"6\">This exercise is conducted openly with access to all needed resources and is thus ideal for benchmarking statistical phrasebased translation systems on a number of language pairs.</S>\n    <S sid=\"115\" ssid=\"7\">The WMT06 corpus is based on sentences extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament.</S>\n    <S sid=\"116\" ssid=\"8\">Separate sentence-aligned parallel corpora of about 700,000 sentences (about 150MB) are provided for the three language pairs having one of French, Spanish and German with English.</S>\n    <S sid=\"117\" ssid=\"9\">SRILM language models based on the same source are also provided for each of the four languages.</S>\n    <S sid=\"118\" ssid=\"10\">We used the provided 2000-sentence devsets for tuning loglinear parameters, and tested on the 3064-sentence test sets.</S>\n    <S sid=\"119\" ssid=\"11\">Results are shown in table 1 for relativefrequency (RF), Good-Turing (GT), Kneser-Ney with 1 (KN1) and 3 (KN3) discount coefficients; and loglinear combinations of both RF and KN3 phrasetables with Zens-Ney-IBM1 (ZN-IBM1) smoothed phrasetables (these combinations are denoted RF+ZN-IBM1 and KN3+ZN-IBM1).</S>\n    <S sid=\"120\" ssid=\"12\">It is apparent from table 1 that any kind of phrase table smoothing is better than using none; the minimum improvement is 0.45 BLEU, and the difference between RF and all other methods is statistically significant.</S>\n    <S sid=\"121\" ssid=\"13\">Also, KneserNey smoothing gives a statistically significant improvement over GT smoothing, with a minimum gain of 0.30 BLEU.</S>\n    <S sid=\"122\" ssid=\"14\">Using more discounting coefficients does not appear to help.</S>\n    <S sid=\"123\" ssid=\"15\">Smoothing relative frequencies with an additional Zens-Ney phrasetable gives about the same gain as KneserNey smoothing on its own.</S>\n    <S sid=\"124\" ssid=\"16\">However, combining Kneser-Ney with Zens-Ney gives a clear gain over any other method (statistically significant for all language pairs except en→es and en→de) demonstrating that these approaches are complementary.</S>\n    <S sid=\"125\" ssid=\"17\">To test the effects of smoothing with larger corpora, we ran a set of experiments for Chinese-English translation using the corpora distributed for the NIST MT05 evaluation (www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt).</S>\n    <S sid=\"126\" ssid=\"18\">These are summarized in table 2.</S>\n    <S sid=\"127\" ssid=\"19\">Due to the large size of the out-of-domain UN corpus, we trained one phrasetable on it, and another on all other parallel corpora (smoothing was applied to both).</S>\n    <S sid=\"128\" ssid=\"20\">We also used a subset of the English Gigaword corpus to augment the LM training material.</S>\n    <S sid=\"129\" ssid=\"21\">Table 3 contains results for the Chinese-English experiments, including fixed-discount with unigram smoothing (FDU), and Koehn-Och-Marcu smoothing with the IBM1 model (KOM-IBM1) as described in section 3.3.</S>\n    <S sid=\"130\" ssid=\"22\">As with the broad-coverage experiments, all of the black-box smoothing techniques do significantly better than the RF baseline.</S>\n    <S sid=\"131\" ssid=\"23\">However, GT appears to work better in the large-corpus setting: it is statistically indistinguishable from KN3, and both these methods are significantly better than all other fixeddiscount variants, among which there is little difference.</S>\n    <S sid=\"132\" ssid=\"24\">Not surprisingly, the two glass-box methods, ZN-IBM1 and KOM-IBM1, do poorly when used on their own.</S>\n    <S sid=\"133\" ssid=\"25\">However, in combination with another phrasetable, they yield the best results, obtained by RF+ZN-IBM1 and GT+KOM-IBM1, which are statistically indistinguishable.</S>\n    <S sid=\"134\" ssid=\"26\">In constrast to the situation in the broad-coverage setting, these are not significantly better than the best black-box method (GT) on its own, although RF+ZN-IBM1 is better than all other glass-box combinations.</S>\n    <S sid=\"135\" ssid=\"27\">A striking difference between the broadcoverage setting and the Chinese-English setting is that in the former it appears to be beneficial to apply KN3 smoothing to the phrasetable that gets combined with the best glass-box phrasetable (ZN), whereas in the latter setting it does not.</S>\n    <S sid=\"136\" ssid=\"28\">To test whether this was due to corpus size (as the broad-coverage corpora are around 10% of those for Chinese-English), we calculated ChineseEnglish learning curves for the RF+ZN-IBM1 and KN3-ZN-IBM1 methods, shown in figure 1.</S>\n    <S sid=\"137\" ssid=\"29\">The results are somewhat inconclusive: although the KN3+ZN-IBM1 curve is perhaps slightly flatter, the most obvious characteristic is that this method appears to be highly sensitive to the particular corpus sample used.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"6 Conclusion and Future Work\" number=\"7\">\n    <S sid=\"138\" ssid=\"1\">We tested different phrasetable smoothing techniques in two different translation settings: European language pairs with relatively small corpora, and Chinese to English translation with large corpora.</S>\n    <S sid=\"139\" ssid=\"2\">The smoothing techniques fall into two categories: black-box methods that work only on phrase-pair counts; and glass-box methods that decompose phrase probabilities into lexical probabilities.</S>\n    <S sid=\"140\" ssid=\"3\">In our implementation, black-box techniques use linear interpolation to combine relative frequency estimates with smoothing distributions, while glass-box techniques are combined in loglinear fashion with either relative-frequencies or black-box estimates.</S>\n    <S sid=\"141\" ssid=\"4\">All smoothing techniques tested gave statistically significant gains over pure relative-frequency estimates.</S>\n    <S sid=\"142\" ssid=\"5\">In the small-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of KneserNey count smoothing with Zens-Ney glass-box smoothing; this yields an average gain of 1.6 BLEU points over relative frequencies.</S>\n    <S sid=\"143\" ssid=\"6\">In the large-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of relative-frequency estimates with Zens-Ney smoothing, with a gain of 1.1 BLEU points.</S>\n    <S sid=\"144\" ssid=\"7\">Of the two glass-box smoothing methods tested, Zens-Ney appears to have a slight advantage over Koehn-Och-Marcu.</S>\n    <S sid=\"145\" ssid=\"8\">Of the blackbox methods tested, Kneser-Ney is clearly better for small corpora, but is equivalent to GoodTuring for larger corpora.</S>\n    <S sid=\"146\" ssid=\"9\">The paper describes several smoothing alternatives which we intend to test in future
