Wiebe, 2000).</S>\n    <S sid=\"16\" ssid=\"9\">For the latter, the traditional bag-of-words representation is not sufficient, and a richer, structural representation is required.</S>\n    <S sid=\"17\" ssid=\"10\">A straightforward way to extend the traditional bag-of-words representation is to heuristically add new types of features to the original bag-of-words features, such as fixed-length n-grams (e.g., word bi-gram or tri-gram) or fixedlength syntactic relations (e.g., modifier-head relations).</S>\n    <S sid=\"18\" ssid=\"11\">These ad-hoc solutions might give us reasonable performance, however, they are highly taskdependent and require careful design to create the “optimal” feature set for each task.</S>\n    <S sid=\"19\" ssid=\"12\">Generally speaking, by using text processing systems, a text can be converted into a semi-structured text annotated with parts-of-speech, base-phrase information or syntactic relations.</S>\n    <S sid=\"20\" ssid=\"13\">This information is useful in identifying opinions or modalities contained in the text.</S>\n    <S sid=\"21\" ssid=\"14\">We think that it is more useful to propose a learning algorithm that can automatically capture relevant structural information observed in text, rather than to heuristically add this information as new features.</S>\n    <S sid=\"22\" ssid=\"15\">From these points of view, this paper proposes a classification algorithm that captures sub-structures embedded in text.</S>\n    <S sid=\"23\" ssid=\"16\">To simplify the problem, we first assume that a text to be classified is represented as a labeled ordered tree, which is a general data structure and a simple abstraction of text.</S>\n    <S sid=\"24\" ssid=\"17\">Note that word sequence, base-phrase annotation, dependency tree and an XML document can be modeled as a labeled ordered tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"25\" ssid=\"18\">The algorithm proposed here has the following characteristics: i) It performs learning and classification using structural information of text. ii) It uses a set of all subtrees (bag-of-subtrees) for the feature set without any constraints. iii) Even though the size of the candidate feature set becomes quite large, it automatically selects a compact and relevant feature set based on Boosting.</S>\n    <S sid=\"26\" ssid=\"19\">This paper is organized as follows.</S>\n    <S sid=\"27\" ssid=\"20\">First, we describe the details of our Boosting algorithm in which the subtree-based decision stumps are applied as weak learners.</S>\n    <S sid=\"28\" ssid=\"21\">Second, we show an implementation issue related to constructing an efficient learning algorithm.</S>\n    <S sid=\"29\" ssid=\"22\">We also discuss the relation between our algorithm and SVMs (Boser et al., 1992) with tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002).</S>\n    <S sid=\"30\" ssid=\"23\">Two experiments on the opinion and modality classification tasks are employed to confirm that subtree features are important.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"2 Classifier for Trees\" number=\"2\">\n    <S sid=\"31\" ssid=\"1\">We first assume that a text to be classified is represented as a labeled ordered tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"32\" ssid=\"2\">The focused problem can be formalized as a general problem, called the tree classification problem.</S>\n    <S sid=\"33\" ssid=\"3\">The tree classification problem is to induce a mapping f(x) : X → {±1}, from given training examples T = {hxi, yii}Li=1, where xi ∈ X is a labeled ordered tree and yi ∈ {±1} is a class label associated with each training data (we focus here on the problem of binary classification.).</S>\n    <S sid=\"34\" ssid=\"4\">The important characteristic is that the input example xi is represented not as a numerical feature vector (bagof-words) but a labeled ordered tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"35\" ssid=\"5\">Let us introduce a labeled ordered tree (or simply tree), its definition and notations, first.</S>\n    <S sid=\"36\" ssid=\"6\">We denote the number of nodes in t as |t|.</S>\n    <S sid=\"37\" ssid=\"7\">Figure 1 shows an example of a labeled ordered tree and its subtree and non-subtree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"38\" ssid=\"8\">Decision stumps are simple classifiers, where the final decision is made by only a single hypothesis or feature.</S>\n    <S sid=\"39\" ssid=\"9\">Boostexter (Schapire and Singer, 2000) uses word-based decision stumps for topic-based text classification.</S>\n    <S sid=\"40\" ssid=\"10\">To classify trees, we here extend the decision stump definition as follows.</S>\n    <S sid=\"41\" ssid=\"11\">Definition 3 Decision Stumps for Trees Let t and x be labeled ordered trees, and y be a class label (y ∈ {±1}), a decision stump classifier for trees is given by The parameter for classification is the tuple ht, yi, hereafter referred to as the rule of the decision stumps.</S>\n    <S sid=\"42\" ssid=\"12\">The decision stumps are trained to find rule hˆt, ˆyi that minimizes the error rate for the given training data T = {hxi, yii}Li=1: In this paper, we will use gain instead of error rate for clarity.</S>\n    <S sid=\"43\" ssid=\"13\">The decision stumps classifiers for trees are too inaccurate to be applied to real applications, since the final decision relies on the existence of a single tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"44\" ssid=\"14\">However, accuracies can be boosted by the Boosting algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1996; Schapire and Singer, 2000).</S>\n    <S sid=\"45\" ssid=\"15\">Boosting repeatedly calls a given weak learner to finally produce hypothesis f, which is a linear combination of K hypotheses produced by the prior weak learners, i,e.</S>\n    <S sid=\"46\" ssid=\"16\">: A weak learner is built at each iteration k with different distributions or weights d(k) = (d(k) The weights are calculated in such a way that hard examples are focused on more than easier examples.</S>\n    <S sid=\"47\" ssid=\"17\">To use the decision stumps as the weak learner of Boosting, we redefine the gain function (2) as follows: There exist many Boosting algorithm variants, however, the original and the best known algorithm is AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996).</S>\n    <S sid=\"48\" ssid=\"18\">We here use Arc-GV (Breiman, 1999) instead of AdaBoost, since Arc-GV asymptotically maximizes the margin and shows faster convergence to the optimal solution than AdaBoost.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"3 Efficient Computation\" number=\"3\">\n    <S sid=\"49\" ssid=\"1\">In this section, we introduce an efficient and practical algorithm to find the optimal rule (ˆt, ˆy) from given training data.</S>\n    <S sid=\"50\" ssid=\"2\">This problem is formally defined as follows.</S>\n    <S sid=\"51\" ssid=\"3\">Problem 1 Find Optimal Rule Let T = {(x1, y1, d1), ..., (xL, yL, dL)} be training data, where, xi is a labeled ordered tree, yi E {+1} is a class label associated with xi and di (EL i=1 di = 1, di &gt; 0) is a normalized weight assigned to xi.</S>\n    <S sid=\"52\" ssid=\"4\">Given T, find the optimal rule (ˆt, ˆy) that maximizes the gain, i.e., The most naive and exhaustive method, in which we first enumerate all subtrees F and then calculate the gains for all subtrees, is usually impractical, since the number of subtrees is exponential to its size.</S>\n    <S sid=\"53\" ssid=\"5\">We thus adopt an alternative strategy to avoid such exhaustive enumeration.</S>\n    <S sid=\"54\" ssid=\"6\">The method to find the optimal rule is modeled as a variant of the branch-and-bound algorithm, and is summarized in the following strategies: We will describe these steps more precisely in the following subsections.</S>\n    <S sid=\"55\" ssid=\"7\">Abe and Zaki independently proposed an efficient method, rightmost-extension, to enumerate all subtrees from a given tree (Abe et al., 2002; Zaki, 2002).</S>\n    <S sid=\"56\" ssid=\"8\">First, the algorithm starts with a set of trees consisting of single nodes, and then expands a given tree of size (k − 1) by attaching a new node to this tree to obtain trees of size k. However, it would be inefficient to expand nodes at arbitrary positions of the tree, as duplicated enumeration is inevitable.</S>\n    <S sid=\"57\" ssid=\"9\">The algorithm, rightmost extension, avoids such duplicated enumerations by restricting the position of attachment.</S>\n    <S sid=\"58\" ssid=\"10\">We here give the definition of rightmost extension to describe this restriction in detail.</S>\n    <S sid=\"59\" ssid=\"11\">Definition 4 Rightmost Extension (Abe et al., 2002; Zaki, 2002) Let t and t' be labeled ordered trees.</S>\n    <S sid=\"60\" ssid=\"12\">We say t' is a rightmost extension of t, if and only if t and t' satisfy the following three conditions: Consider Figure 2, which illustrates example tree t with the labels drawn from the set G = {a, b, c}.</S>\n    <S sid=\"61\" ssid=\"13\">For the sake of convenience, each node in this figure has its original number (depth-first enumeration).</S>\n    <S sid=\"62\" ssid=\"14\">The rightmost-path of the tree t is (a(c(b))), and occurs at positions 1, 4 and 6 respectively.</S>\n    <S sid=\"63\" ssid=\"15\">The set of rightmost extended trees is then enumerated by simply adding a single node to a node on the rightmost path.</S>\n    <S sid=\"64\" ssid=\"16\">Since there are three nodes on the rightmost path and the size of the label set is 3 (= |G|), a total of 9 trees are enumerated from the original tree t. Note that rightmost extension preserves the prefix ordering of nodes in t (i.e., nodes at positions 1..|t |are preserved).</S>\n    <S sid=\"65\" ssid=\"17\">By repeating the process of rightmost-extension recursively, we can create a search space in which all trees drawn from the set G are enumerated.</S>\n    <S sid=\"66\" ssid=\"18\">Figure 3 shows a snapshot of such a search space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"67\" ssid=\"19\">Rightmost extension defines a canonical search space in which one can enumerate all subtrees from a given set of trees.</S>\n    <S sid=\"68\" ssid=\"20\">We here consider an upper bound of the gain that allows subspace pruning in this canonical search space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"69\" ssid=\"21\">The following theorem, an extension of Morhishita (Morhishita, 2002), gives a convenient way of computing a tight upper bound on gain(ht', yi) for any super-tree t' of t. We can efficiently prune the search space spanned by right most extension using the upper bound of gain u(t).</S>\n    <S sid=\"70\" ssid=\"22\">During the traverse of the subtree lattice built by the recursive process of rightmost extension, we always maintain the temporally suboptimal gain τ among all gains calculated previously.</S>\n    <S sid=\"71\" ssid=\"23\">If µ(t) &lt; τ, the gain of any super-tree t' ⊇ t is no greater than τ, and therefore we can safely prune the search space spanned from the subtree t. If µ(t) ≥ τ, in contrast, we cannot prune this space, since there might exist a super-tree t' ⊇ t such that gain(t') ≥ τ.</S>\n    <S sid=\"72\" ssid=\"24\">We can also prune the space with respect to the expanded single node s. Even if µ(t) ≥ τ and a node s is attached to the tree t, we can ignore the space spanned from the tree t' if µ(s) &lt; τ, since no super-tree of s can yield optimal gain.</S>\n    <S sid=\"73\" ssid=\"25\">Figure 4 presents a pseudo code of the algorithm Find Optimal Rule.</S>\n    <S sid=\"74\" ssid=\"26\">The two pruning are marked with (1) and (2) respectively.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"4 Relation to SVMs with Tree Kernel\" number=\"4\">\n    <S sid=\"75\" ssid=\"1\">Recent studies (Breiman, 1999; Schapire et al., 1997; R¨atsch et al., 2001) have shown that both Boosting and SVMs (Boser et al., 1992) have a similar strategy; constructing an optimal hypothesis that maximizes the smallest margin between the positive and negative examples.</S>\n    <S sid=\"76\" ssid=\"2\">We here describe a connection between our Boosting algorithm and SVMs with tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002).</S>\n    <S sid=\"77\" ssid=\"3\">Tree kernel is one of the convolution kernels, and implicitly maps the example represented in a labeled ordered tree into all subtree spaces.</S>\n    <S sid=\"78\" ssid=\"4\">The implicit mapping defined by tree kernel is given as: Φ(x)=(I(t1 ⊆ x), ... , I(t|F |⊆ x)), where tj∈F, x ∈ X and I(·) is the indicator function 1.</S>\n    <S sid=\"79\" ssid=\"5\">The final hypothesis of SVMs with tree kernel can be given by Similarly, the final hypothesis of our boosting algorithm can be reformulated as a linear classifier: 1Strictly speaking, tree kernel uses the cardinality of each substructure.</S>\n    <S sid=\"80\" ssid=\"6\">However, it makes little difference since a given tree is often sparse in NLP and the cardinality of substructures will be approximated by their existence.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"Algorithm: Find Optimal Rule\" number=\"5\">\n    <S sid=\"81\" ssid=\"1\">argument: T = {hx1, y1, d1i ..., hxL, yL, dLi} (xi a tree, yi ∈ {±1} is a class, and di (PLi=1 di = 1, di ≥ 0) is a weight) returns: Optimal rule hˆt, ˆyi begin We can thus see that both algorithms are essentially the same in terms of their feature space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"82\" ssid=\"2\">The difference between them is the metric of margin; the margin of Boosting is measured in l1-norm, while, that of SVMs is measured in l2-norm.</S>\n    <S sid=\"83\" ssid=\"3\">The question one might ask is how the difference is expressed in practice.</S>\n    <S sid=\"84\" ssid=\"4\">The difference between them can be explained by sparseness.</S>\n    <S sid=\"85\" ssid=\"5\">It is well known that the solution or separating hyperplane of SVMs is expressed as a linear combination of the training examples using some coefficients A, (i.e., w = PL i=1 AiΦ(xi)).</S>\n    <S sid=\"86\" ssid=\"6\">Maximizing l2norm margin gives a sparse solution in the example space, (i.e., most of Ai becomes 0).</S>\n    <S sid=\"87\" ssid=\"7\">Examples that have non-zero coefficient are called support vectors that form the final solution.</S>\n    <S sid=\"88\" ssid=\"8\">Boosting, in contrast, performs the computation explicitly in the feature space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"89\" ssid=\"9\">The concept behind Boosting is that only a few hypotheses are needed to express the final solution.</S>\n    <S sid=\"90\" ssid=\"10\">The l1-norm margin allows us to realize this property.</S>\n    <S sid=\"91\" ssid=\"11\">Boosting thus finds a sparse solution in the feature space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"92\" ssid=\"12\">The accuracies of these two methods depends on the given training data.</S>\n    <S sid=\"93\" ssid=\"13\">However, we argue that Boosting has the following practical advantages.</S>\n    <S sid=\"94\" ssid=\"14\">First, sparse hypotheses allow us to build an efficient classification algorithm.</S>\n    <S sid=\"95\" ssid=\"15\">The complexity of SVMs with tree kernel is O(L'|N1||N2|), where N1 and N2 are trees, and L' is the number of support vectors, which is too heavy to realize real applications.</S>\n    <S sid=\"96\" ssid=\"16\">Boosting, in contrast, runs faster, since the complexity depends only on the small number of decision stumps.</S>\n    <S sid=\"97\" ssid=\"17\">Second, sparse hypotheses are useful in practice as they provide “transparent” models with which we can analyze how the model performs or what kind of features are useful.</S>\n    <S sid=\"98\" ssid=\"18\">It is difficult to give such analysis with kernel methods, since they define the feature space implicitly.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"5 Experiments\" number=\"6\">\n    <S sid=\"99\" ssid=\"1\">We conducted two experiments in sentence classification.</S>\n    <S sid=\"100\" ssid=\"2\">The goal of this task is to classify reviews (in Japanese) for PHS2 as positive reviews or negative reviews.</S>\n    <S sid=\"101\" ssid=\"3\">A total of 5,741 sentences were collected from a Web-based discussion BBS on PHS, in which users are directed to submit positive reviews separately from negative reviews.</S>\n    <S sid=\"102\" ssid=\"4\">The unit of classification is a sentence.</S>\n    <S sid=\"103\" ssid=\"5\">The categories to be identified are “positive” or “negative” with the numbers 2,679 and 3,062 respectively.</S>\n    <S sid=\"104\" ssid=\"6\">This task is to classify sentences (in Japanese) by modality.</S>\n    <S sid=\"105\" ssid=\"7\">A total of 1,710 sentences from a Japanese newspaper were manually annotated according to Tamura’s taxonomy (Tamura and Wada, 1996).</S>\n    <S sid=\"106\" ssid=\"8\">The unit of classification is a sentence.</S>\n    <S sid=\"107\" ssid=\"9\">The categories to be identified are “opinion”, “assertion” or “description” with the numbers 159, 540, and 1,011 respectively.</S>\n    <S sid=\"108\" ssid=\"10\">To employ learning and classification, we have to represent a given sentence as a labeled ordered tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"109\" ssid=\"11\">In this paper, we use the following three representation forms.</S>\n    <S sid=\"110\" ssid=\"12\">Ignoring structural information embedded in text, we simply represent a text as a set of words.</S>\n    <S sid=\"111\" ssid=\"13\">This is exactly the same setting as Boostexter.</S>\n    <S sid=\"112\" ssid=\"14\">Word boundaries are identified using a Japanese morphological analyzer, ChaSen3.</S>\n    <S sid=\"113\" ssid=\"15\">We represent a text in a word-based dependency tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"114\" ssid=\"16\">We first use CaboCha4 to obtain a chunk-based dependency tree of the text.</S>\n    <S sid=\"115\" ssid=\"17\">The chunk approximately corresponds to the basephrase in English.</S>\n    <S sid=\"116\" ssid=\"18\">By identifying the head word in the chunk, a chunk-based dependency tree is converted into a word-based dependency tree.</S>\n    <S sid=\"117\" ssid=\"19\">It is the word-based dependency tree that assumes that each word simply modifies the next word.</S>\n    <S sid=\"118\" ssid=\"20\">Any subtree of this structure becomes a word n-gram.</S>\n    <S sid=\"119\" ssid=\"21\">We compared the performance of our Boosting algorithm and support vector machines (SVMs) with bag-of-words kernel and tree kernel according to their F-measure in 5-fold cross validation.</S>\n    <S sid=\"120\" ssid=\"22\">Although there exist some extensions for tree kernel (Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002), we use the original tree kernel by Collins (Collins and Duffy, 2002), where all subtrees of a tree are used as distinct features.</S>\n    <S sid=\"121\" ssid=\"23\">This setting yields a fair comparison in terms of feature space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"122\" ssid=\"24\">To extend a binary classifier to a multi-class classifier, we use the one-vs-rest method.</S>\n    <S sid=\"123\" ssid=\"25\">Hyperparameters, such as number of iterations K in Boosting and soft-margin parameter C in SVMs were selected by using cross-validation.</S>\n    <S sid=\"124\" ssid=\"26\">We implemented SVMs with tree kernel based on TinySVM5 with custom kernels incorporated therein.</S>\n    <S sid=\"125\" ssid=\"27\">Table 1 summarizes the results of PHS and MOD tasks.</S>\n    <S sid=\"126\" ssid=\"28\">To examine the statistical significance of the results, we employed a McNemar’s paired test, a variant of the sign test, on the labeling disagreements.</S>\n    <S sid=\"127\" ssid=\"29\">This table also includes the results of significance tests.</S>\n    <S sid=\"128\" ssid=\"30\">In all tasks and categories, our subtree-based Boosting algorithm (dep/ngram) performs better than the baseline method (bow).</S>\n    <S sid=\"129\" ssid=\"31\">This result supports our first intuition that structural information within texts is important when classifying a text by opinions or modalities, not by topics.</S>\n    <S sid=\"130\" ssid=\"32\">We also find that there are no significant differences in accuracy between dependency and n-gram (in all cases, p &gt; 0.2).</S>\n    <S sid=\"131\" ssid=\"33\">When using the bag-of-words feature, no significant differences in accuracy are observed between Boosting and SVMs.</S>\n    <S sid=\"132\" ssid=\"34\">When structural information is used in training and classification, Boosting performs slightly better than SVMs with tree kernel.</S>\n    <S sid=\"133\" ssid=\"35\">The differences are significant when we use dependency features in the MOD task.</S>\n    <S sid=\"134\" ssid=\"36\">SVMs show worse performance depending on tasks and categories, (e.g., 24.2 F-measure in the smallest category “opinion” in the MOD task).</S>\n    <S sid=\"135\" ssid=\"37\">When a convolution kernel is applied to sparse data, kernel dot products between almost the same instances become much larger than those between different instances.</S>\n    <S sid=\"136\" ssid=\"38\">This is because the number of common features between similar instances exponentially increases with size.</S>\n    <S sid=\"137\" ssid=\"39\">This sometimes leads to overfitting in training , where a test instance very close to an instance in training data is correctly classified, and other instances are classified as a default class.</S>\n    <S sid=\"138\" ssid=\"40\">This problem can be tackled by several heuristic approaches: i) employing a decay factor to reduce the weights of large sub-structures (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002). ii) substituting kernel dot products for the Gaussian function to smooth the original kernel dot products (Haussler, 1999).</S>\n    <S sid=\"139\" ssid=\"41\">These approaches may achieve better accuracy, however, they yield neither the fast classification nor the interpretable feature space targeted by this paper.</S>\n    <S sid=\"140\" ssid=\"42\">Moreover, we cannot give a fair comparison in terms of the same feature space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"141\" ssid=\"43\">The selection of optimal hyperparameters, such as decay factors in the first approach and smoothing parameters in the second approach, is also left to as an open question.</S>\n    <S sid=\"142\" ssid=\"44\">We employed a McNemar’s paired test on the labeling disagreements.</S>\n    <S sid=\"143\" ssid=\"45\">Underlined results indicate that there is a significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) against the baseline (bow).</S>\n    <S sid=\"144\" ssid=\"46\">If there is a statistical difference (p &lt; 0.01) between Boosting and SVMs with the same feature representation (bow / dep / n-gram), better results are asterisked.</S>\n    <S sid=\"145\" ssid=\"47\">In the previous section, we described the merits of our Boosting algorithm.</S>\n    <S sid=\"146\" ssid=\"48\">We experimentally verified these merits from the results of the PHS task.</S>\n    <S sid=\"147\" ssid=\"49\">As illustrated in section 4, our method can automatically select relevant and compact features from a number of feature candidates.</S>\n    <S sid=\"148\" ssid=\"50\">In the PHS task, a total 1,793 features (rules) were selected, while the set sizes of distinct uni-gram, bi-gram and trigram appearing in the data were 4,211, 24,206, and 43,658 respectively.</S>\n    <S sid=\"149\" ssid=\"51\">Even though all subtrees are used as feature candidates, Boosting selects a small and highly relevant subset of features.</S>\n    <S sid=\"150\" ssid=\"52\">When we explicitly enumerate the subtrees used in tree kernel, the number of active (non-zero) features might amount to ten thousand or more.</S>\n    <S sid=\"151\" ssid=\"53\">Table 2 shows examples of extracted support features (pairs of feature (tree) t and weight wt in (Eq.</S>\n    <S sid=\"152\" ssid=\"54\">5)) in the PHS task.</S>\n    <S sid=\"153\" ssid=\"55\">A.</S>\n    <S sid=\"154\" ssid=\"56\">Features including the word “にくい (hard, difficult)” In general, “にくい (hard, difficult)” is an adjective expressing negative opinions.</S>\n    <S sid=\"155\" ssid=\"57\">Most of features including “にくい” are assigned a negative weight (negative opinion).</S>\n    <S sid=\"156\" ssid=\"58\">However, only one feature “切れに くい (hard to cut off)” has a positive weight.</S>\n    <S sid=\"157\" ssid=\"59\">This result strongly reflects the domain knowledge, PHS (cell phone reviews).</S>\n    <S sid=\"158\" ssid=\"60\">B.</S>\n    <S sid=\"159\" ssid=\"61\">Features including the word “使う (use)” “使う (use)” is a neutral expression for opinion classifications.</S>\n    <S sid=\"160\" ssid=\"62\">However, the weight varies according to the surrounding context: 1) “使い たい (want to use)” → positive, 2) “使い やす い (be easy to use)” → positive, 3) “使い やす か った (was easy to use)” (past form) → negative, 4) “の ほうが 使い やすい (... is easier to use than ..)” (comparative) → negative.</S>\n    <S sid=\"161\" ssid=\"63\">C. Features including the word “充電 (recharge)” Features reflecting the domain knowledge are extracted: 1) “充電 時間 が 短い (recharging time is short)” → positive, 2) “充電 時間 長い (recharging time is long)” → negative.</S>\n    <S sid=\"162\" ssid=\"64\">These features are interesting, since we cannot determine the correct label (positive/negative) by using just the bag-of-words features, such as “recharge”, “short” or “long” alone.</S>\n    <S sid=\"163\" ssid=\"65\">Table 3 illustrates an example of actual classification.</S>\n    <S sid=\"164\" ssid=\"66\">For the input sentence “液晶が大きくて, 綺麗, 見やすい (The LCD is large, beautiful, and easy to see.</S>\n    <S sid=\"165\" ssid=\"67\">)”, the system outputs the features applied to this classification along with their weights wt.</S>\n    <S sid=\"166\" ssid=\"68\">This information allows us to analyze how the system classifies the input sentence in a category and what kind of features are used in the classification.</S>\n    <S sid=\"167\" ssid=\"69\">We cannot perform these analyses with tree kernel, since it defines their feature space implicitly.</S>\n    <S sid=\"168\" ssid=\"70\">The testing speed of our Boosting algorithm is much higher than that of SVMs with tree kernel.</S>\n    <S sid=\"169\" ssid=\"71\">In the PHS task, the speeds of Boosting and SVMs are 0.531 sec./5,741 instances and 255.42 sec./5,741 instances respectively 6.</S>\n    <S sid=\"170\" ssid=\"72\">We can say that Boosting is about 480 times faster than SVMs with tree kernel.</S>\n    <S sid=\"171\" ssid=\"73\">Even though the potential size of search space is huge, the pruning criterion proposed in this paper effectively prunes the search space.</S>\n    <S sid=\"172\" ssid=\"74\">The pruning conditions in Fig.4 are fulfilled with more than 90% probabitity.</S>\n    <S sid=\"173\" ssid=\"75\">The training speed of our method is 1,384 sec./5,741 instances when we set K = 60, 000 (# of iterations for Boosting).</S>\n    <S sid=\"174\" ssid=\"76\">It takes only 0.023 (=1,384/60,000) sec. to invoke the weak learner, Find Optimal Rule.</S>\n  </SECTION>\n  <SECTION title=\"6 Conclusions and Future Work\" number=\"7\">\n    <S sid=\"175\" ssid=\"1\">In this paper, we focused on an algorithm for the classification of semi-structured text in which a sentence is represented as a labeled ordered tree7.</S>\n    <S sid=\"176\" ssid=\"2\">Our proposal consists of i) decision stumps that use subtrees as features and ii) Boosting algorithm in which the subtree-based decision stumps are applied as weak learners.</S>\n    <S sid=\"177\" ssid=\"3\">Two experiments on opinion/modality classification tasks confirmed that subtree features are important.</S>\n    <S sid=\"178\" ssid=\"4\">One natural extension is to adopt confidence rated predictions to the subtree-based weak learners.</S>\n    <S sid=\"179\" ssid=\"5\">This extension is also found in BoosTexter and shows better performance than binary-valued learners.</S>\n    <S sid=\"180\" ssid=\"6\">In our experiments, n-gram features showed comparable performance to dependency features.</S>\n    <S sid=\"181\" ssid=\"7\">We would like to apply our method to other applications where instances are represented in a tree and their subtrees play an important role in classifications (e.g., parse re-ranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002) and information extraction).</S>\n  </SECTION>\n</PAPER>",
